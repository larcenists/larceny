The bench shell script must be run from this directory.  When it is run,
there must be a link in the directory to an executable 'larceny' and
links to two heap images: 'larceny.heap' should be the basic heap image,
and 'twobit.heap' should be the twobit heap image.

Say:
	./bench larceny all

If the purpose of the run is to test performance, then
 - larceny.heap should have been initialized, re-dumped and treated 
   with -reorganize-and-dump
 - all files should resize on a local file system
