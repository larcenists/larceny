Larceny is a simple and efficient implementation of the
Scheme programming language.

This is now Larceny's official home for developers.  This site
was created by cloning Larceny's previous RCS+CVS+SVN history,
while making some attempt to clean up the history of those
repositories.

To download released versions of Larceny, see Larceny's official
web site at http://www.larcenists.org/ .

If you cloned this repository, be sure to read README-FIRST.txt.
More documentation is also available in doc/, such as the files
and directories:

  * doc/HOWTO-BUILD
  * doc/HOWTO-INSTALL
  * doc/UserManual/
  * doc/LarcenyNotes/

among many others.
