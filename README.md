Larceny is a simple and efficient implementation of the
Scheme programming language.

This is now Larceny's official home for developers.  This site
was created by cloning Larceny's previous RCS+CVS+SVN history,
while making some attempt to clean up the history of those
repositories.

To download released versions of Larceny, see Larceny's official
web site at http://www.larcenists.org/ .

That web site has not been updated since the beta release of
v0.98b1 in 2009.  We are now working to add preliminary support
for the [R7RS (small)](http://www.scheme-reports.org/) standard
to Larceny's R6RS and R5RS/IEEE modes of operation.  When v0.98
is released, the web site will be updated.

If you cloned this repository, be sure to read README-FIRST.txt.
More documentation is also available in doc/, such as the files
and directories:

  * doc/HOWTO-BUILD
  * doc/HOWTO-INSTALL
  * doc/UserManual/
  * doc/LarcenyNotes/

among many others.
