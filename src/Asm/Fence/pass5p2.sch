; Asm/Fence/pass5p2.sch -- Fence machine assembler, top level
;
; The fence translates MacScheme machine language (high-level
; intermediate language) to Cant (low-level intermediate language).  A
; translator from Cant to a target machine language is simple yet
; amenable to optimization, see eg pass5p2-arm.sch.
;
; We make some simplifying assumptions:
;  - Load-store architecture
;  - Floating-point register file (not an 8087-like stack)
;  - "Appropriate" alignment of data and 8-byte alignment of stack frames
;  - GLOBALS, STKP, and SECOND are stored in hardware registers
;  - SECOND is used extensively as a temporary
;  - The return address is always stored in the frame (never in LR)
;  - TIMER, ETOP, and THIRD are stored in the globals array
;  - Exceptions in generated code are all non-continuable
;
; Features:
;  - Little/big-endian independent.
;  - By and large it is 64-bit clean.
;  - Direct support for floating point operations.
;
; TODO:
;  - Sundry local improvements, search for TODO below
;  - Support more switches, notably inline allocation, inline barrier.
;  - EMIT-EXCEPTION should maintain a table of in-line exception 
;    handlers (registers moved and exception triggered), and emit
;    branches to existing handlers instead of new handlers; the
;    optimizer should carefully optimize branch-over-branch to
;    reverse the condition and eliminate the redundant branch.
;  - Add the missing parts of the 64-bit support, search for FIXME64.

; Arguably a hack, should define these elsewhere.  But they are
; target-independent.
