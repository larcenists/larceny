R6RS SCHEME SCRIPTS

On most Unix systems (including MacOS X and Linux), Larceny's
scheme-script will execute Scheme scripts as described in R6RS
non-normative appendix D, with or without the optional script
header [1].  To make Scheme scripts executable in their own
right, without executing scheme-script directly, add Larceny's
root directory to your path as described in doc/HOWTO-INSTALL.

Suppose, for example, that /home/myself/hello is an R6RS
Scheme script whose first line is the optional script header
(#!/usr/bin/env scheme-script).  If you do not have execute
permission for this script, or Larceny's root directory is
not in your path, then you can still run the script from
Larceny's root directory as follows:
     
    % ./scheme-script /home/myself/hello

If you have execute permission for the script, and Larceny's
root directory is in your path, then you can also run the
script as follows:

    % /home/myself/hello

If, in addition, the directory that contains the script is
in your path, then you can run the script as follows:

    % hello


R6RS TOP-LEVEL PROGRAMS

R6RS top-level programs are similar to Scheme scripts, but
are executed by an R6RS-compatible processor such as Larceny
instead of being directly executable on Unix machines.  To
execute an R6RS top-level program, see HOWTO-R6RS.


R5RS SCRIPTING

Suppose hello.sch contains the following R5RS code:

    (display "Hello world!")
    (newline)
    (exit)

You can run hello.sch as a script by executing Larceny as
follows:

    % larceny -nobanner -- hello.sch

You can redirect Larceny's standard input, in which case
you may want to eliminate the read/eval/print loop's prompt:

    % larceny -nobanner -- -e "(repl-prompt values)" < hello.sch

For an explanation of why that works, which may suggest other
creative uses of Larceny, ask for help:

    % larceny -help
