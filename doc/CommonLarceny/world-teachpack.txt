= Common Larceny World Teachpack

The world teachpack provides two kinds of functions. Those of the first kind 
allow students to simulate a small world of animated drawings and games. Those
of the second kind provide functionality for creating scenes, or composite 
images with their pinholes in their upper-left hand corner.

This teachpack is based on the PLT world teachpack and provides the same methods 
as well as some new ones. Much of this documentation is borrowed from PLT.

== Implementation

The world teachpack is designed so that it can be implemented on different 
systems. For example, the provided implementation runs, in conjunction with
CommonLarceny, on the Microsoft .NET 2.0 Framework. Another implementation
for a different scheme system or GUI framework could be developed, if one
so desired.

== Use

To use the functions provided by the world teachpack, load the implementation-
specific file, e.g. `(load "lib/teachpacks/world-dotnet.sch)`.

=== Background Knowledge

The following functions are provided by the world teachpack. For information on
programming the world, please visit 
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP/Worldv300/[] for a tutorial 
by Matthias Felleisen.

=== World Functions

`big-bang : Number Number Number World -> true`

`(big-bang width height n w)` creates and shows a `width` x `height` canvas, 
starts the clock, makes it tick every `n` seconds, and makes `w` the first world. 
This function should always be evaluated last, because it actually creates the
world. Therefore, the following functions should be evaluted first, to 
handle tick, keyboard, and mouse events in the world.

`on-tick-event : (World -> World) -> true`

`(on-tick-event tock)` means that DrScheme must call `tock` on the current world 
every time the clock ticks; it uses the result as the next world 

`on-key-event : (World KeyEvent -> World) -> true`

`(on-key-event change)` means that DrScheme must call `change` on the current 
world and a (representation of the) keyevent for every keystroke the 
programmer (user of the computer) makes; it uses the result as the next 
world 

A *KeyEvent* is one of: 

  -- Char (char?)
  -- Symbol (symbol?)

When the Keyevent is a char, the programmer (user of the computer) has hit an
alphanumeric key. Symbols such as `'left`, `'right`, `'up`, `'down`, `'release`
denote arrow keys or the events of releasing a key on the keypad. 

`on-mouse-event : (World Number Number MouseEvent -> World) -> true`

`(on-mouse-event clack)` means that DrScheme must call `clack` on the current 
world, the current `x` and `y` coordinates of the mouse, and and a 
(representation of the) mouse event for every action of the mouse the 
programmer (user of the computer) makes; it uses the result as the next world 

A *MouseEvent* is one of:
  
  -- 'button-down
  -- 'button-up
  -- 'drag
  -- 'move
  -- 'enter
  -- 'leave

The symbols denote the appropriate action with the mouse and (any of) its 
button(s).

`on-redraw : (World -> Scene) -> true`

`(on-redraw world->scene)` means that DrScheme calls `world->scene` whenever the
canvas must be redrawn (usually after a tick/keyboard/mouse event has occurred);
the function consumes the current world and produces a scene, which is then 
displayed in the teachpack's canvas 

`end-of-time : String or Symbol -> World`

When DrScheme evaluates `(end-of-time)`, it stops the clock and displays the 
given string or symbol; no further tick events, key events, or redraw events 
take place until the world is created again. 

=== Scene Functions

The rest are functions for creating scenes: 

`nw:rectangle : Number Number Mode Color -> Image`

`(nw:rectangle width height mode color)` creates a `width` x `height` rectangle, 
  solid or outlined, with its anchor in the NW corner 
  
`empty-scene : Number Number -> Scene`

`(empty-scene width height)` creates a `width` x `height` "scene" (frame with 
origin in NW) 

`place-image : Image Number Number Scence -> Scene`

`(place-image image x y scene)` places `image` at `(x,y)` into scene; `(x,y)`
are computer graphics coordinates (origin in the upper left hand corner)

`add-line : Scene Number Number Number Number Color -> Scene`

`(add-line scene x0 y0 x1 y1 c)` places a line of color `c` from `(x0,y0)` to 
`(x1,y1)` into `scene`; `(x,y)` are computer graphics coordinates; in contrast 
to the image teachpack's `add-line` function, this one cuts off those portions 
of the line that  go beyond the boundaries of the given scene. 

`run-movie : (Listof Image) -> true`

`(run-movie loi)` shows the list of images in loi, time-delayed 

Finally, the teachpack provides all the functions that image teachpack provides 
except `add-line`, which has a slightly different functionality.

== Examples

The files in `/lib/teachpacks/` that begin with `demo-` show how to 
create worlds and simple animations. They are derived from Matthias's demo 
(see above).
