File naming conventions
-----------------------


[[SuffixSection]]

Suffixes
~~~~~~~~

In Larceny, file names generally follow Unix conventions,
even on Windows.  The following suffixes have special
meanings to some components of Larceny.

`.sls`
is the preferred suffix for files that contain
ERR5RS/R6RS-compatible library definitions or
top-level programs (with import declarations).

`.sch`
is the preferred suffix for files that contain R5RS
source code.

`.scm`
is an alternative suffix for files that contain R5RS source code.

`.slfasl`
is the suffix for files that contain the pre-compiled
form of ERR5RS/R6RS-compatible code.

`.fasl`
is the suffix for files that contain the pre-compiled form of R5RS code.

`.mal`
is the preferred suffix for files that contain MacScheme
assembly language in symbolic form.

`.lap`
is the suffix for files that contain MacScheme assembly language.

`.lop`
is the suffix for files that contain machine code
segments in the form expected by Larceny's heap linker.

`.heap`
is the suffix for files that contain an executable heap
image (must be combined with the
<<InstallationSection,`larceny.bin`>> runtime).


[[DirectorySection]]

Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~

Larceny's root directory should contain the following
files:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    larceny
    twobit
    scheme-script
    larceny.bin
    larceny.heap
    twobit.heap
    startup.sch
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following subdirectories are also essential for correct
operation of some features of some modes in some varieties of
Larceny:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    include
    lib
    lib/Base
    lib/Debugger
    lib/Ffi
    lib/MzScheme
    lib/R6RS
    lib/SRFI
    lib/Standard
    lib/TeachPacks
----------------------------------------------------------------

The `include` subdirectory is used when compiling files with
Petit Larceny.

The `startup.sch` file tells Larceny's `require` procedure to
search some of the `lib` subdirectories for libraries that are
loaded dynamically.


[[LibraryResolutionSection]]

Resolving references to libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The R6RS does not specify any mapping from library names to
files or to other locations at which the code for a library
might be found.  As R6RS non-normative appendix E puts it:

________________________________________________________________
Implementations may take radically different approaches to
storing source code for libraries, among them: files in the
file system where each file contains an arbitrary number of
library forms, files in the file system where each file
contains exactly one library form, records in a database,
and data structures in memory....Implementations may provide
a means for importing libraries....
________________________________________________________________

In other words, implementations are allowed to extend the
R6RS with arbitrary mechanisms for resolving references to
imported libraries, but R6RS programs that rely on such
mechanisms are not portable.  In particular, R6RS libraries
are not portable.

Larceny provides four distinct Larceny-specific
mechanisms that non-portable R6RS programs can use to
import or to define libraries:

1.  ERR5RS and R6RS standard libraries may be imported.
Their code is located automagically.

2.  Nonstandard libraries, such as `(larceny compiler)`,
may be placed in one of the directories that are searched
by Larceny's
<<ERR5RSLibraryPathSection,autoload>> feature, provided
those libraries are located in files that follow Larceny's
standard naming conventions as described in the next section.

3.  R6RS top-level programs may use
<<R6RSLibraryPathSection, Larceny's `-path` option>>
to specify a directory that contains other libraries
the program may import, provided those libraries are
located in files that follow Larceny's standard naming
conventions as described in the next section.

4.  R6RS top-level programs and Scheme scripts may
<<DefiningLibrariesSection, define their own libraries>>
in the same file that contains the top-level program or
Scheme script.

ERR5RS programs may use any of those four mechanisms,
and may also use a fifth mechanism:
An ERR5RS program can be written as a little configuration
program that loads the program's libraries from files
before any libraries are imported.  This fifth mechanism
is portable, but is not available to R6RS programs.


[[LibraryTranslationSection]]

Mapping library names to files (ERR5RS/R6RS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose Larceny's `-path` option is used to specify
a certain _directory_, and the program imports a
nonstandard library whose name is of the form
`(_name1_ _name2_ ... _lastname_)`.
Larceny will search for that library in the following
files:

- `_directory_/_name1_/_name2_/.../_lastname_.slfasl`
- `_directory_/_name1_/_name2_/.../_lastname_.sls`
- ...
- `_directory_/_name1_/_name2_.slfasl`
- `_directory_/_name1_/_name2_.sls`
- `_directory_/_name1_.slfasl`
- `_directory_/_name1_.sls`

The search starts with the first of those file names,
continues with the following file names in order,
and ends when a file with one of those names is found.
The imported library _must_ be one of the libraries
defined within the first file found by this search,
since the search is not continued after that first file
is found (except as noted in the next paragraph).

If the search ends by finding a file whose name ends
with `.slfasl`, then Larceny checks to see whether
there is a file in the same directory with the same
root name but ending with `.sls` instead of `.slfasl`.
If the `.sls` file has been modified since the `.slfasl`
file was last modified, then a warning is printed and
the `.sls` file is loaded instead of the `.slfasl` file.
Otherwise the `.slfasl` file is loaded.

[NOTE]
================================================================
The R6RS allows arbitrary mappings from library names to library
code.  Larceny takes advantage of this by ignoring version
numbers when mapping library names to files, and by (virtually)
rewriting any version number that may be specified in the
definition of a library so it matches any version specification
that appears within the `import` form.  Furthermore Larceny
allows different versions of the same library to be imported,
but Larceny's algorithm for resolving library references
ensures that the different versions of a library will be
identical except for their version numbers, which have no
meaningful semantics.  Although Larceny's treatment of versions
conforms to the R6RS specification, it should be clear that
version numbers serve no purpose in Larceny.  Since the R6RS
version feature has no usefully portable semantics, it is
deprecated.
================================================================


[[RequireLibraryTranslationSection]]

Mapping library names to files (R5RS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In R5RS mode, Larceny's `-path` option may be used to
specify a directory to be searched by the `require`
procedure, which takes a single symbol _libname_ as
its argument.
The `require` procedure will search for the following
files in every directory that is part of the current
require path, starting with the directory specified
by the `-path` option:

- `_libname_.fasl`
- `_libname_.sch`
- `_libname_.scm`

These files are expected to contain R5RS code, not
library definitions.  Otherwise the search proceeds
much the same as when searching for an ERR5RS/R6RS
library.

[NOTE]
================================================================
The `require` path is specified by `startup.sch` in Larceny's
root directory, but may be changed dynamically using the
`current-require-path` parameter.  Changing the `require` path
is not recommended, however, because Larceny relies on the
`require` path for dynamic loading of libraries used by several
important features of Larceny, notably ERR5RS and R6RS modes.
================================================================

proc:require[args="libname"]

_libname_ must be a symbol that names an R5RS-compatible
library within the current require path.

If the library has not already been loaded, then it is
located and loaded.  If the library is found and loaded
successfully, then `require` returns true; otherwise an
error is signalled.

If the library has already been loaded, then `require`
returns false without loading the library a second time.

proc:current-require-path[args="",optarg="stringlist",result="stringlist"]

The optional argument is a list of directory names
(without slashes at the end) that should be searched
by <<require,`require`>> and (in ERR5RS/R6RS modes)
by Larceny's <<ERR5RSLibraryPathSection,autoload>>
feature.
Returns the list of directory names that will be
searched.
