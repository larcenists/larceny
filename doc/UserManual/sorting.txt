Sorting
~~~~~~~

The `(rnrs sorting)` library now
provides a small set of procedures that supersede most
of the procedures described below.
All of the procedures described below are therefore
deprecated.

_Procedures sort and sort!_

proctempl:sort[args="list less?",result="list"]
proctempl:sort[args="vector less?",result="vector"]
proctempl:sort![args="list less?",result="list"]
proctempl:sort![args="vector less?",result="vector"]

These procedures sort their argument (a list or a vector) according to
the predicate _less?_, which must implement a total order on the
elements in the data structures that are sorted.

Sort returns a fresh data structure containing the sorted data; sort!
sorts the data structure in-place.
