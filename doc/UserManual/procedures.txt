Procedures

_Operations on procedures_

proctempl:make-procedure[args="length",result="procedure"]
proctempl:procedure-length[args="procedure",result="fixnum"]
proctempl:procedure-ref[args="procedure offset",result="object"]
proctempl:procedure-set![args="procedure offset object",result="unspecified"]

These procedures operate on the representations of procedures and
allow user programs to construct, inspect, and alter procedures.

proc:procedure-copy[args="procedure",result="procedure"]

Returns a shallow copy of the procedure.

_ The rest of this section describes some procedures that extract
heuristic information from procedures, for debugging purposes. The
text is copied from a straw proposal authored by Will Clinger and sent
to rrr-authors on 09 May 1996. The text has been edited lightly. See
the end for notes about the Larceny implementation. _

The procedures that extract heuristic information from procedures are
permitted to return any result whatsoever. If the type of a result is
not among those listed below, then the result represents an
implementation-dependent extension to this interface, which may safely
be interpreted as though no information were available from the
procedure. Otherwise the result is to be interpreted as described
below.

proc:procedure-arity[args="proc"]

Returns information about the arity of _proc_. If the result is #F,
then no information is available. If the result is an exact
non-negative integer _k_, then _proc_ requires exactly _k_
arguments. If the result is an inexact non-negative integer _n_, then
_proc_ requires _n_ or more arguments. If the result is a pair, then
it is a list of non-negative integers, each of which indicates a
number of arguments that will be accepted by _proc_; the list is not
necessarily exhaustive.

proc:procedure-documentation-string[args="proc"]

Returns general information about _proc_. If the result is #F, then no
information is available. If the result is a string, then it is to be
interpreted as a "documentation string" (see Common Lisp).

proc:procedure-name[args="proc"]

Returns information about the name of _proc_. If the result is #F,
then no information is available. If the result is a symbol or string,
then it represents a name. If the result is a pair, then it is a list
of symbols and/or strings representing a path of names; the first
element represents an outer name and the last element represents an
inner name.

proc:procedure-source-file[args="proc"]

Returns information about the name of a file that contains the source
code for _proc_. If the result is #F, then no information is
available. If the result is a string, then the string is the name of a
file.

proc:procedure-source-position[args="proc"]

Returns information about the position of the source code for _proc_
whithin the source file specified by procedure-source-file. If the
result is #F, then no information is available. If the result is an
exact integer _k_, then _k_ characters precede the opening parenthesis
of the source code for _proc_ within that source file.

proc:procedure-expression[args="proc"]

Returns information about the source code for _proc_. If the result is
#F, then no information is available. If the result is a pair, then it
is a lambda expression in the traditional representation of a list.

proc:procedure-environment[args="proc"]

Returns information about the environment of _proc_. If the result is
#F, then no information is available. In any case the result may be
passed to any of the <<SectionEnvironments,environment inquiry functions>>.

**Notes on the Larceny implementation**

Twobit does not yet produce data for all of these functions, so some
of them always return #f.
