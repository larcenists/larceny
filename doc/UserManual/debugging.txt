Debugging
---------

Larceny's debugging functionality is implemented in Scheme, using some
of Larceny's extensions for catching exceptions and inspecting the
continuation structure.

=== Entering the debugger

When Larceny detects an error or a keyboard interrupt, or when it hits
a breakpoint, it signals the condition by printing a message on the
console. Larceny then enters the debugger, which signals its presence
with a short banner and the debugger prompt:
    
    
        Entering debugger; type "?" for help.
        debug>
    

You can also re-enter the debugger by evaluating (debug).

=== Debugger commands

The debugger is still in an immature state. The following commands are available (commands can be typed in upper or lower case): 

**B**     Print backtrace of continuation.

**C**     Print source code of procedure, if available.

**D**     Move down to previous (earlier) activation record.

**E _n expr_**      _Expr_ is evaluated in the current
interaction environment and must evaluate to a procedure.
It is passed the contents of slot _n_ from the current
activation record, and the result, if not unspecified,
is printed.

**E _(n1 ... nk) expr_**      _Expr_ is evaluated in the current
interaction environment and must evaluate to a procedure. It is
passed the contents of slots _n1_ through _nk_ from the current
activation record, and the result, if not unspecified, is printed.

**I _n_**      Inspect the procedure in slot _n_ of the current
activation record.

**I @_**      Inspect the active procedure.

**Q**      Quit the debugger and abort the computation.

**R**      Return from the debugger and continue the computation.

**S**      Summarize the contents of the current activation record.

**U**      Up to the next (later) activation record.

**X**      Examine the contents of the current activation record. 

The **B**, **D**, and **U** commands can be prefixed with a count, for example, 5 U moves up five activation records, and 10 B displays the next 10 activation records. The default for **B** is to display all the activations; the default count for **D** and **U** is 1. 

=== Breakpoints

You can set breakpoints either in program text with the break primitive or interactively at the start of a procedure with the break-entry procedure. When Larceny reaches a breakpoint during execution, the program is suspended and the debugger is entered to allow you to inspect the program. 


proc:larceny-break[args=""]

Invokes the breakpoint handler.

proc:break-entry[args="procedure"]

Set a breakpoint at the start of the _procedure_.

proc:unbreak[args="procedure ..."]

proctempl:unbreak[args=""]

In the first form, remove any breakpoint set by break-entry at the start of the _procedure_s. In the second form, remove all breakpoints set by _break-entry_.

=== Tracing

proc:trace-entry[args="procedure"]

Set a trace point on entry to the _procedure_, removing any other trace points on the procedure. When the _procedure_ is entered, information about the call is printed on the console: the name of the procedure and the actual arguments.

proc:trace-exit[args="procedure"]

Set a trace point on exit from the _procedure_, removing any other trace points on the procedure. When the _procedure_ returns, information about the return is printed on the console: the name of the procedure and the returned values.

Note that trace-exit destroys the tail recursion properties of the instrumented procedure. Where the _procedure_ would normally "return" by tail-calling another procedure, the instrumented procedure will call the other procedure by a non-tail call and then return, at which point the procedure name and return values will be printed. Thus use of trace-exit may destroy the space properties of the program.

proc:trace[args="procedure"]

Set trace points on _procedure_ both at entry and exit.

proc:untrace[args="procedure ..."]

proctempl:untrace[args=""]

The first form removes any trace points from the specified procedures.
The second form removes all untrace points.

=== Other functionality

anchor:break-handler[]
indexterm:[break-handler]
_Parameter break-handler_     

The value of break-handler is a procedure that is called when a breakpoint or tracepoint is encountered. The procedure takes two arguments: the procedure in which the breakpoint was set, and the byte offset within the procedure's code vector of the breakpoint.
