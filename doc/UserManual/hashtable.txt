Hashtables and hash functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hashtables represent finite mappings from keys to values.
If the hash function is a good one, then the value associated
with a key may be looked up in constant time (on the average).

[NOTE]
================================================================
Although R7RS Red Edition now includes a `(scheme hash-table)`
library, that library deprecates several of the procedures it
exports, and the efficiency of its `eq?` and `eqv?` hash tables
depends upon a fragile, implementation-dependent hack.

We recommend programmers use `(srfi 126)` instead of
`(scheme hash-table)`.

Larceny supports the following hash table libraries, which are
listed in decreasing order of quality:

- `(srfi 126)`
- `(rnrs hashtables)`
- `(scheme hash-table)`
- `(srfi 125)`
- Larceny's old-style hashtables, described below.
- `(srfi 69)`

In Larceny, hash tables created by those libraries are largely
interchangeable, but that is unlikely to be true in other
implementations of Scheme.  Even in Larceny, hash tables created
using the `(srfi 126)` and `(rnrs hashtables)` libraries may be
substantially more efficient than some of the hash tables created
by seemingly analogous mechanisms in the other libraries.
================================================================

[NOTE]
================================================================
To resolve a clash of names and semantics with the
R6RS `make-hashtable` procedure, Larceny's traditional
`make-hashtable` procedure has been renamed to
`make-oldstyle-hashtable`.
================================================================

[WARNING]
================================================================
The API described below is deprecated.  R6RS-style hashtables
are available even in Larceny's R5RS mode, and should be used
instead of the procedures described below.
================================================================


==== Hash tables

proc:make-oldstyle-hashtable[args="hash-function bucket-searcher size",result="hashtable"]

Returns a newly allocated mutable hash table using _hash-function_ as
the hash function and _bucket-searcher_, e.g. `assq`, `assv`, `assoc`, to
search a bucket with _size_ buckets at first, expanding the number of
buckets as needed. The _hash-function_ must accept a key and return a
non-negative exact integer.

proctempl:make-oldstyle-hashtable[args="hash-function bucket-searcher",result="hashtable"]

Equivalent to `(make-oldstyle-hashtable _hash-function bucket-searcher n_)` for
some value of _n_ chosen by the implementation.

proctempl:make-oldstyle-hashtable[args="hash-function",result="hashtable"]

Equivalent to `(make-oldstyle-hashtable _hash-function_ assv)`.

proctempl:make-oldstyle-hashtable[args="",result="hashtable"]

Equivalent to `(make-oldstyle-hashtable object-hash assv)`.

proc:hashtable-contains?[args="hashtable key",result="bool"]

Returns true iff the _hashtable_ contains an entry for _key_.

proc:hashtable-fetch[args="hashtable key flag",result="object"]

Returns the value associated with _key_ in the _hashtable_ if the
_hashtable_ contains _key_; otherwise returns _flag_.

proc:hashtable-get[args="hashtable key",result="object"]

Equivalent to `(hashtable-fetch  #f)`.

proc:hashtable-put![args="hashtable key value",result="unspecified"]

Changes the _hashtable_ to associate _key_ with _value_, replacing any
existing association for _key_.

proc:hashtable-remove![args="hashtable key",result="unspecified"]

Removes any association for _key_ within the _hashtable_. 

proc:hashtable-clear![args="hashtable",result="unspecified"]

Removes all associations from the _hashtable_.

proc:hashtable-size[args="hashtable",result="integer"]

Returns the number of keys contained within the _hashtable_.

proc:hashtable-for-each[args="procedure hashtable",result="unspecified"]

The _procedure_ must accept two arguments, a key and the value
associated with that key. Calls the _procedure_ once for each
key-value association in _hashtable_. The order of these calls is
indeterminate.

proc:hashtable-map[args="procedure hashtable",results="unspecified"]

The _procedure_ must accept two arguments, a key and the value
associated with that key. Calls the _procedure_ once for each
key-value association in _hashtable_, and returns a list of the
results. The order of the calls is indeterminate.

proc:hashtable-copy[args="hashtable",result="hashtable"]

Returns a copy of the _hashtable_.

==== Hash functions

The _hash values_ returned by these functions are nonnegative exact
integer suitable as hash values for the hashtable functions.

proc:equal-hash[args="object",result="integer"]

Returns a hash value for _object_ based on its contents.

proc:object-hash[args="object",result="integer"]

Returns a hash value for _object_ based on its identity.

[WARNING]
================================================================
This hash function performs extremely poorly on pairs,
vectors, strings, and bytevectors, which are the objects
with which it is mostly likely to be used.
For efficient hashing on object identity, create the
hashtable with `make-eq-hashtable` or `make-eqv-hashtable`
of the `(rnrs hashtables)` library.
================================================================

proc:string-hash[args="string",result="fixnum"]

Returns a hash value for _string_ based on its content.

proc:symbol-hash[args="symbol",result="fixnum"]

Returns a hash value for _symbol_ based on its print name.
The `symbol-hash`
is very fast, because the hash code is cached in the symbol data
structure.
