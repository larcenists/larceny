proc:collect[args="none",result="unspecified"]
proctempl:collect[args="generation",result="unspecified"]
proctempl:collect[args="generation method",result="unspecified"]

Collect initiates a garbage collection. If the system has multiple
generations, then the optional arguments are interpreted as
follows. The _generation_ is the generation to collect, where 0 is the
youngest generation. The _method_ determines how the collection is
performed. If _method_ is the symbol collect, then a full collection
is performed in that generation, whatever that means -- in a normal
multi-generational copying collector, it means that all live objects
in the generation's current semispace and all live objects from all
younger generations are copied into the generation's other
semispace. If _method_ is the symbol promote, then live objects are
promoted from younger generations into the target generation -- in our
example collector, that means that the objects are copied into the
target generation's current semispace.

The default value for _generation_ is 0, and the default value for
_method_ is collect.

Note that the collector's internal policy settings may cause it to
perform a more major type of collection than the one requested; for
example, an attempt to collect generation 2 could cause the collector
to promote all live data into generation 3.

proc:gc-counter[args="none",result="fixnum"]

_GC-counter_ returns the number of garbage collections performed since
startup. On a 32-bit system, the counter wraps around every
1,073,741,824 collections.

_GC-counter_ is a primitive and compiles to a single load instruction
on the SPARC.

proc:gcctl[args="heap-number operation operand",result="unspecified"]

_[GCCTL is largely obsolete in the new garbage collector but may be
resurrected in the future. It can still be used to control the
non-predictive collector.]_

gcctl controls garbage collection policy on a heap-wise basis. The
_heap-number_ is the heap to operate on, like for the command line
switches: heap 1 is the youngest. If the given heap number does not
correspond to a heap, gcctl fails silently.

The _operation_ is a symbol that selects the operation to perform, and
the _operand_ is the operand to that operation, always a number. For
the non-predictive garbage collector, the following operator/operand
pairs are meaningful:

  * j-fixed, _n_: after a collection, the collector parameter _j_ should be set to the value _n_, if possible. (Non-predictive heaps only.) 
  * j-percent, _n_: after a collection, the collector parameter _j_ should be set to be _n_ percent of the number of free steps. (Non-predictive heaps only.) 
  * incr-fixed, _n_: when growing the heap, the growing should be done in increments of _n_. In the non-predictive heap, _n_ is the number of steps. In other heaps, _n_ denotes kilobytes. 
  * incr-percent, _n_: when growing the heap, the growing should be done in increments of _n_ percent. 

**Example:** if the non-predictive heap is heap number 2, then the expressions 
    
    
            (gcctl 2 'j-fixed 0)
            (gcctl 2 'incr-fixed 1)
    

makes the non-predictive collector simulate a normal stop-and-copy
collector (because _j_ is always set to 0), and grows the heap only
one step at a time as necessary. This may be useful for certain kinds
of experiments.

**Example:** ditto, the expressions 
    
    
            (gcctl 2 'j-percent 50)
            (gcctl 2 'incr-percent 20)
    

selects the default policy settings.

**Note**: The gcctl facility is experimental. A more developed
  facility will allow controlling heap contraction policy, as well as
  setting all the watermarks. Certainly one can envision other uses,
  too. Finally, it needs to be possible to get current values.

**Note**: Currently the non-predictive heap (np-sc-heap.c) and the
  standard stop-and-copy "old" heap (old-heap.c) are supported, but
  not the standard "young" heap (young-heap.c), nor the stop-and-copy
  collector (sc-heap.c).

proc:sro[args="pointer-tag type-tag limit",result="vector"]

SRO ("standing room only") is a system primitive that traverses the
entire heap and returns a vector that contains all live objects in the
heap that satisfy the constraints imposed by its parameters:

  * If _pointer-tag_ is -1, then object type is unconstrained;
    otherwise, the object type is constrained to have a pointer tag
    that matches _pointer-tag_. You can read all about pointer tags
    <<LarcenyNoteRepr,here>>, but the short story is that 1=pair, 3=vector-like,
    5=bytevector-like, and 7=procedure-like.

  * If _type-tag_ is -1, then object type is unconstrained by
    type-tag; otherwise, only objects with a matching type-tag are
    selected (after selection by pointer tag). Pairs don't have
    type-tags, but other objects do. You can read all about type-tags
    <<LarcenyNoteRepr,here>>.

  * _Limit_ constrains the selected objects by the number of
    references. If _limit_ is -1, then no constraints are imposed;
    otherwise, only objects (selected by pointer-tag and type-tag)
    with no more than _limit_ references to them are selected.

For example, (sro -1 -1 -1) returns a vector that contains all live
objects (not including the vector), and (sro 5 2 3) returns a vector
containing all live flonums (bytevector-like, with typetag 2) that are
referred to in no more than 3 places.

proc:stats-dump-on[args="filename",result="unspecified"]

Stats-dump-on turns on garbage collection statistics dumping. After
each collection, a complete RTS statistics dump is appended to the
file named by _filename_.

The file format and contents are documented in a banner written at the
top of the output file. In addition, accessor procedures for the
output structure are defined in the program Util/process-stats.sch.

Stats-dump-on does not perform an initial dump when the file is first
opened; only at the first collection is the first set of statistics
dumped. The user might therefore want to initiate a minor collection
just after turning on dumping in order to have a baseline set of data.

proc:stats-dump-off[args="none",result="unspecified"]

Stats-dump-off turns off garbage collection statistics dumping (which
was turned on with <<stats-dump-on>>). It does not dump a final set
of statistics before closing the file; therefore, the user may wish to
initiate a minor collection before calling this procedure.

proc:system-features[args="none",result="alist"]

System-features returns an association lists of system features. Most
entries are self-explanatory. The following are a more subtle:

  * The value of architecture-name is Larceny's notion of the architecture for which it was compiled, not the architecture the program is currently running on. For example, the value of this feature is "Standard-C" if you're running Petit Larceny. 
  * The value of heap-area-info is a vector of vectors, one subvector for each heap area in the running system. The subvector has four entries: the generation number, the area type, the current size, and additional information. 

proc:display-memstats[args="vector",result="unspecified"]
proctempl:display-memstats[args="vector minimal",result="unspecified"]
proctempl:display-memstats[args="vector minimal full",result="unspecified"]

Display-memstats takes as its argument a vector as returned by
<<memstats>> and displays the contents of the vector in
human-readable form on the current output port. By default, not all of
the values in the vector are displayed.

If the symbol minimal is passed as the second argument, then only a
small number of statistics generally relevant to running benchmarks
are displayed.

If the symbol full is passed as the second argument, then all
statistics are displayed.

proc:memstats[args="none",result="vector"]

Memstats returns a freshly allocated vector containing run-time-system
resource usage statistics. Many of these will make no sense whatsoever
to you unless you also study the RTS sources. A listing of the
contents of the vector is available <<SectionMemstats,here>>.

proc:run-with-stats[args="thunk",result="obj"]

Run-with-stats evaluates _thunk_, then prints a short summary of
run-time statistics, as with
    
       (display-memstats ... 'minimal),
    
and then returns the result of evaluating _thunk_.

proc:run-benchmark[args="name k thunk ok?",result="obj"]

Run-benchmark prints a short banner (including the identifying _name_)
to identify the benchmark, then runs _thunk_ _k_ times, and finally
tests the value returned from the last call to _thunk_ by applying the
predicate _ok?_ to it. If the predicate returns true, then
run-benchmark prints summary statistics, as with
    
       ([display-memstats][5] ... 'minimal).
    
If the predicate returns false, an error is signalled.
