SLIB support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB.html[SLIB]
is a large collection of useful libraries that have been
written or collected by Aubrey Jaffer.

Larceny supports SLIB via SRFI 96, but SLIB is not shipped
with Larceny; it must be downloaded separately and then
installed.
For the most up-to-date information on installing and using
SLIB with Larceny, see +doc/HOWTO-SLIB+.
