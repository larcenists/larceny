Bytevectors
~~~~~~~~~~~

A _bytevector_ is a data structure that stores bytes -- exact
8-bit unsigned integers. Bytevectors are useful in constructing
system interfaces and other low-level programming. In Larceny,
many bytevector-like structures -- strings, bignums, and even
bytevectors themselves -- are implemented in terms of a
lower-level _bytevector-like_ data type. The operations on
generic bytevector-like structures are particularly fast but
useful largely in code that manipulates Larceny's data
representations.

The R6RS <<BytevectorsLibrary, bytevectors library>> now
provides a large set of procedures that, in Larceny, are
defined using the procedures described below.

proc:make-bytevector[kind="Integrable procedure",args="length",result="bytevector"]
proc:make-bytevector[kind="Integrable procedure",args="length fill",result="bytevector"]

Returns a bytevector of the desired length.
If no second argument is given, then the bytevector has not
been initialized and most likely contains garbage.

_Operations on bytevector structures_

proctempl:bytevector?[args="obj",result="boolean"]

proctempl:bytevector-length[args="bytevector",result="integer"]

proctempl:bytevector-ref[args="bytevector offset",result="byte"]

proctempl:bytevector-set![args="bytevector offset byte",result="unspecified"]

proctempl:bytevector-equal?[args="bytevector1 bytevector2",result="boolean"]

proctempl:bytevector-fill![args="bytevector byte",result="unspecified"]

proctempl:bytevector-copy[args="bytevector",result="bytevector"]

These procedures do what you expect. All procedures are integrable, except bytevector-equal? and bytevector-copy. 

_Operations on bytevector-like structures_

proctempl:bytevector-like?[args="obj",result="boolean"]

proctempl:bytevector-like-length[args="bytevector",result="integer"]

proctempl:bytevector-like-ref[args="bytevector offset",result="byte"]

proctempl:bytevector-like-set![args="bytevector offset byte",result="unspecified"]

proctempl:bytevector-like-equal?[args="bytevector1 bytevector2",result="boolean"]

proctempl:bytevector-like-copy[args="bytevector",result="bytevector"]
    

A bytevector-like structure is a low-level representation on which data that are indexable like bytevectors are built, e.g., bytevectors, strings, bignums, and flonums.

There is no way of constructing a "generic" bytevector-like structure; use the constructors for the data mapped onto bytevector-like structures instead, like make-string or make-bytevector.

The bytevector-like operations operate on all bytevector-like structures. All the procedures are integrable, except bytevector-like-equal? and bytevector-like-copy.
