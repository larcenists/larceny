R7RS standard libraries
-----------------------

The R7RS standard libraries are described by
<<Standards,the R7RS (small) standard>> approved in 2013.

Larceny provides all of the R7RS standard libraries,
supports the full numeric tower, and can represent all
Unicode characters.

Binary releases of Larceny also support Unicode strings.
(When built from source code, Larceny can be configured to
use Latin-1 strings instead of Unicode.)

When Larceny is invoked with the `-r7r6` option on its
command line, all of the standard R7RS and R6RS libraries
are imported at startup.  When invoked with the `-r7rs`
option, only `(scheme base)` is imported at startup.

Known deviations from the R7RS standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Larceny v0.98 does not implement these features of
the R7RS standard:

- the second (arbitrary ellipsis) form of `syntax-rules`
  described in R7RS section 4.3.2
- `include` and `include-ci` at expression level
- `cond-expand` at expression level

`include`, `include-ci`, and `cond-expand` are fully supported
at the top-level declaration and definition levels of R7RS
libraries.

To simplify interoperability with R6RS libraries and
programs, the `integer?`, `rational?`, and `real?`
procedures exported by `(scheme base)` have R6RS semantics.
It is not clear whether that is fully compatible with the
R7RS (small) standard, because the R7RS specification of
those procedures appears to contradict itself.

If any other R7RS feature is missing or incompatible with
the R7RS (small) standard, it's a bug.
