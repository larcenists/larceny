R7RS Standard Libraries
-----------------------

The R7RS standard libraries are described by the
<<Standards, R7RS (small)>> standard approved in 2013
and by the
<<Standards, R7RS Red Edition>> standard approved in 2016.
The
<<R7rsPreDefinedSection,Predefined libraries>> section
of this manual lists the names of those libraries.

Larceny provides all of the R7RS standard libraries,
supports the full numeric tower, and can represent all
Unicode characters.

Binary releases of Larceny also support Unicode strings.
(When built from source code, Larceny can be configured to
use Latin-1 strings instead of Unicode.)

When Larceny is invoked with the `-r7r6` option on its
command line, and no program is given on the command line,
all of the standard R7RS and R6RS libraries
are imported at startup.  When invoked with the `-r7`
option and no program, only `(scheme base)` is imported at startup.
When a program is given, the `-r7r6` and `-r7` options
are equivalent: both imply the R7RS mode of execution,
but the program is responsible for importing all libraries
it uses, which makes it possible to write R7RS programs
that do not import `(scheme base)`.


[[R7rsDeviationsSection]]

Known deviations from the R7RS standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To simplify interoperability with R6RS libraries and
programs, and to improve the performance of flonum and
complex arithemetic, the `integer?`, `rational?`, and `real?`
procedures exported by `(scheme base)` have R6RS semantics.
It is not clear whether that is fully compatible with the
R7RS (small) standard, because the R7RS specification of
those procedures appears to contradict itself.

To simplify interoperability with R6RS libraries and programs,
`let-syntax` and `letrec-syntax` have R6RS semantics, which
extends the R5RS semantics by allowing their bodies to expand into
definitions instead of or in addition to expressions.  The R6RS
standard requires `let-syntax` and `letrec-syntax` to splice
their macro-expanded bodies into their context instead of
introducing a new contour.  That R6RS behavior is not explicitly
forbidden by the R7RS, but archives of the working group that
developed the R7RS standard record a deliberate decision to break
backward compatibility with R6RS by requiring `let-syntax` and
`letrec-syntax` to introduce a new contour.  Although the R7RS
(small) standard fails to mention this significant change in
semantics, that must have been an oversight.  Programs that
depend upon having `let-syntax` and `letrec-syntax` introduce
new contours can be run in Larceny's `-r7strict` mode, which
will also disable several other generally desirable extensions
and enhancements Larceny has made to the R7RS.

[TIP]
================================================================
If some library or program depends upon `-r7strict`, it can be
<<CompilingR7rsSection,compiled separately>> with `-r7strict` in effect,
allowing its compiled form to interoperate with libraries and
programs that use extensions disabled by `-r7strict`.
================================================================

If any other R7RS feature is missing or incompatible with
the R7RS (small) standard, it's a bug.

As of Larceny v1.3, the known deviations from the R7RS (small)
standard are:

- Libraries with names of the form `(primitives x ...)` cannot be imported.
(Larceny v1.3 reserves <<R7rsPrimitivesSection,primitives>>
as a keyword for importing identifiers from the R5RS global
environment.)

- `include` and `include-ci` are allowed only as library declarations,
and are not allowed in expression contexts.
