==== Summary (Overall behavior)

Larceny can be started in two distinct ways. Those users who use
Larceny only for Scheme programming will usually install it as
described in [the introduction][12] and will run it via the standard
shell script by typing larceny at the shell prompt.

Those users who change Twobit and Larceny, on the other hand, will
also run the shell script -- and also the twobit script -- but will
sometimes need to run a newly-compiled program or newly-built heap
without installing it first. In that case, the binary 'larceny.bin'
will be run directly, as described below.

The command line options in this section apply to both the shell
scripts and the binary program. However, a heap file name may not be
supplied to the shell scripts, and the option -small (described in
[the introduction][12]) is not accepted by the binary program or by
the twobit script.

==== Summary (precise gc)

Larceny is most easily run from the command line with the following
command:
    
         larceny.bin _heap-filename_

That command will run Larceny with the default configuration. (You can
also omit the _heap-filename_, which then defaults to the file
sparc.heap in the current directory.) The default configuration is:

  * Writeable static area for the heap image 
  * Three collected areas: 

    * Nursery (youngest generation): 1Mbyte single space 
    * Ephemeral generation: 2Mbyte, fixed size, two-space copy-collected 
    * Dynamic generation: 3Mbyte, expandable, two-space copy-collected, no size limit, load factor 3.0 

  * Separate large object subspace in each collected area 
  * Remembered set: 16K hash table entries; 16K sequential store buffer (SSB) slots 
  * Breakpoints are enabled 
  * Single stepping is disabled 
  * Printing of startup statistics is disabled 
  * Printing of nonessential messages is enabled 

==== Summary (conservative GC)

Larceny with the conservative collector is run from the command line
with the following command:
    
         bdwlarceny.bin _heap-filename_

That command will run Larceny with the default configuration. (You can
also omit the _heap-filename_, which then defaults to the file
larceny.heap in the current directory.) The default configuration is:

  * Non-generational, non-incremental collection 
  * Breakpoints are disabled 
  * Single stepping is disabled 
  * Printing of startup statistics is disabled 
  * Printing of nonessential messages is enabled 

_Note:_ It is beneficial to run the conservative collector with a
_split heap image_, that is, a heap image where the code vectors and
the other data are separated. Using such a heap image reduces the risk
of accidental storage retention, although it is at the present time
unclear whether the practical benefits are measurable (in Larceny, at
least). The heap image created by the development system is not split,
but you can create such a heap image with Larceny. Click [here][11] to
learn more.

==== Command line format overview

Larceny accepts a number of command line options to control its
configuration and behavior. The summary of the command line format is
as follows:
    
         larceny.bin [ _option_ ... ] [ _heap-filename_ ] [ -args _argument_ ... ]

where each _option_ is described in this document; see the
[contents][13] for a topic listing. If the switch -args is present,
then the arguments following that switch are made available to Scheme
code running in Larceny as a vector of strings; see the description of
the [command-line-arguments][14] procedure.

_Option arguments_: where an argument _size_ is indicated, a
nonnegative integer is expected, optionally followed immediately by
the letter "K" (Kilo) or "M" (Mega); e.g. a size of 512K means 524288
8-bit bytes. Where an argument _n_ is indicated, a nonnegative integer
is expected.

==== Heap allocation options (precise GC)

    -gen      Select the generational garbage collector with the default number of collected areas (3). An area is akin to a generation except that some areas (notably, the non-predictive dynamic area) have multiple generations. 

    -areas _n_      Select the generational garbage collector with _n_ collected areas, where _n_ specifies the number of non-static heap areas the system will use. Implies use of a generational collector. The default for _n_ is 3 and the minimum is 2. 

    -np      Select the generational garbage collector with the non-predictive dynamic area. This option can be combined with -areas to select a specific number of areas. 

    -stopcopy      Select the stop-and-copy garbage collector with one collected area. 

    -nostatic      Disable the static area (which is on by default in all configurations). 

    -size _size_  
    -size_k_ _size_      Specify the size of the data areas, in bytes. If the form -size_k_ is used, then the size for area _k_ is set, all others remain unchanged. Areas are numbered from 1, where area 1 is the youngest. If the more general form is used, then the value specified affects all areas that have not had their size specified individually. 

The dynamic area will grow to accomodate the live data; see -load and -max. 

    -steps _n_  
    -stepsize _size_  
     Select the generational garbage collector and the non-predictive dynamic area, and also set the initial number of steps or the initial step size. 

     -stats      Print a summary of memory allocation statistics at startup time. 

==== GC policy options (precise GC)

    -max _size_      Specify the desired maximum heap size for the dynamic area. This is a very strong suggestion to the collector for that area that it should never allow the size of the area to grow to more than _size_ bytes. In each case when the collector cannot obey this, it prints a message to this effect and temporarily exceeds the limit with the minimal amount it thinks works. 

In practice this appears to work very well. 

   -load _n_      Specify the inverse load factor (ratio of heap storage to live storage) for the dynamic area. This is a decimal number; the default is 3.0. 

   -rhash _size_      Specify the size of the remembered-set hash table, in the number of elements the table will have. The size given must be a power of 2. The default is 16K. _Bug warning: this is ignored in 1.0a1. See BUGS._

   -ssb _size_      Specify the size of the write barrier's Sequential Store Buffer (SSB), as the number of elements the SSB will have. The default is 16K. _Bug warning: this is ignored in 1.0a1. See BUGS._

==== GC policy options (conservative GC)

    -incremental      Enable the conservative collector's incremental, generational mode. **This switch is currently disabled**. I've had no luck whatever using incremental collection under SunOS; this probably has to do with the costly VM write protection under SunOS coupled with the very high frequency of writes. [Here][15] are some musings on the issue. 

==== General options

    -help      Print a summary of the legal command line options. 

    -quiet      Suppress nonessential messages. 

    -annoy-user  
    -annoy-user-greatly      Print annoying messages at major points in the program (garbage collections in older generations, for example). The form -annoy-user-greatly causes the garbage collectors to print messages about promotions and policy decisions also. Try it; you'll hate it. 

==== Developers' options

    -break      _[Development]_ Enable manually-placed breakpoints. 

    -step      _[Development]_ Enable debugging of code compiled with MAL single-stepping enabled. 

==== Startup/configuration file

The default read-eval-print loop looks for a startup/configuration
file when Larceny is started. The file, if found, will be assumed to
contain either Scheme source code or compiled fasl-format code, and
will be loaded before control is passed to the repl. If the file is
found but the load fails, a warning will be printed but the
read-eval-print loop will still be run.

The file .larceny will be taken to be the startup file; Larceny looks
first in the current directory and then in the user's home directory.

==== Reorganizing a heap image

You can create a split heap image by invoking the following command: 
    
        larceny.bin -reorganize-and-dump filename

where filename is the name of an existing heap file. Larceny will read
the heap file, reorganize it into two pieces, one containing code and
one other data, and then dump a new heap file filename.split
containing the split heap. Larceny then exits. The new heap file can
be used as an argument to larceny in future runs.
