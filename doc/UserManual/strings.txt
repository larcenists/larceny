Strings
~~~~~~~

Larceny provides Unicode strings with
http://www.scheme-reports.org/[R7RS]
and
http://www.r6rs.org/[R6RS]
semantics.

The `string-downcase` and `string-upcase` procedures
perform Unicode-compatible case folding, which can result
in a string whose length is different from that of the original.

Larceny may still provide `string-downcase!` and `string-upcase!`
procedures, but they are deprecated.
