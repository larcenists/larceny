Strings
~~~~~~~

Larceny now provides Unicode strings with
http://www.r6rs.org/[R6RS]
semantics.

That means the `string-downcase` and `string-upcase` procedures
now perform Unicode-compatible case folding, which can result
in a string whose length is different from that of the original.

Larceny may still provide `string-downcase!` and `string-upcase!`
procedures, but they are deprecated.
