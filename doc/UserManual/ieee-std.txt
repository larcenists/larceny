IEEE Standard 754-1985,
"IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic",
IEEE, 1985.

IEEE Standard 754-2008,
"IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic",
IEEE, 2008.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754r[Revision of IEEE Std 754-1985]
began in 2000.
The IEEE Microprocessor Standards Committee (MSC)
accepted a candidate draft on 9 October 2006.
The candidate draft 1.2.6 was approved by 79% of 70 votes,
which exceeded the required supermajority of 75%.
Because there were negative votes and several hundred comments,
however, a revised draft 1.3.0 was prepared and approved by
84% of 73 votes.
Since there were over a hundred comments on the
second candidate draft as well, a third candidate draft 1.4.0 was
prepared and another vote taken in April 2007.
After a total of eight ballots, with the last four being
approved by more than 90% of the voters, the Ballot Review
Committee decided in May 2008 that
http://www.validlab.com/754R/[maximum possible timely
consensus has been obtained], and the consensus draft was
submitted to IEEE-SA RevCom.
IEEE-754-2008 was approved on 12 June 2008.)
