ERR5RS Standard Libraries
-------------------------

<<Standards,ERR5RS>> has been superseded by the R7RS, so the
libraries described below are now deprecated.


[[Err5rsLoadSection]]

Load
~~~~

The `(err5rs load)` library has been superseded by the
`(scheme load)` library, and continues to exist only for
backward compatibility.

proc:load[args="filename"]

Loads ERR5RS code from _filename_, evaluating each form
as though it had been entered at the interactive
read/eval/print loop.

[WARNING]
================================================================
The `load` procedure should be used only at an interactive top
level and in files that will be loaded into an interactive top
level.  Calls to the `load` procedure have no effect at compile
time, and should not appear in files that will be compiled
separately; use the `library` and `import` syntaxes instead.
================================================================


[[Err5rsRecordsSection]]

Records
~~~~~~~

The ERR5RS record facility described below incorporates all
optional features of SRFI 99 and is otherwise identical to
the facilities described by SRFI 99.
SRFI 99 is itself an extension of SRFI 9, whose
`define-record-type` syntax is identical to that defined by
the R7RS.

When a procedure is said to be equivalent to an R6RS
procedure, the equivalence holds only when all arguments
have the properties required of them by the R6RS
specification.  ERR5RS does not mandate R6RS exception
semantics for programs that violate the specification.


[[Err5rsRecordsProceduralSection]]

==== Procedural layer

This section describes the `(err5rs records procedural)` library.

proc:make-rtd[args="name fieldspecs",optargs="parent-rtd"]
proctempl:make-rtd[args="name fieldspecs parent-rtd"]
proctempl:make-rtd[args="name fieldspecs parent-rtd option ..."]

_name_ is a symbol, which matters only to the
<<rtd-name,`rtd-name`>> procedure of the inspection layer.
_fieldspecs_ is a vector of field specifiers, where
each field specifier is one of

 * a symbol naming the (mutable) field;

 * a list of the form `(mutable _name_)`,
where _name_ is a symbol naming the mutable field;

 * a list of the form `(immutable _name_)`,
where _name_ is a symbol naming the immutable field. 

The optional parent is an rtd or `#f`. It is an error for
any of the symbols in fieldspecs to name more than one
of the fields specified by fieldspecs, but the field names
in fieldspecs may shadow field names in the parent rtd.

<<make-rtd,`make-rtd`>> returns an R6RS-compatible record-type
descriptor.

Larceny allows the following optional arguments to follow
the optional _parent-rtd_ argument:

 * the symbol `sealed` means the new rtd cannot be used
as the parent of other rtds;

 * the symbol `opaque` means the <<record?,`record?`>> predicate
will not recognize instances of the new rtd;

 * the symbol `uid`, followed by another symbol _id_,
means the new rtd is non-generative with uid _id_; the
semantics of this extension is the same as in the R6RS.

These Larceny-specific options may be used in any
combination, giving Larceny's ERR5RS records the same
expressive power as R6RS records, with which they are
fully interoperable.


proc:rtd?[args="obj"]

This predicate returns true if and only if its argument
is a record-type descriptor.
`rtd?` is equivalent to the `record-type-descriptor?`
procedure of the R6RS.


proc:rtd-constructor[args="rtd"]
proctempl:rtd-constructor[args="rtd fieldspecs"]

_rtd_ is a record-type descriptor, and _fieldspecs_ is
an optional vector of symbols.

If no _fieldspecs_ argument is supplied,
then `rtd-constructor` returns a procedure that expects
one argument for each field of the record-type described
by _rtd_ and returns an instance of that record-type
with its fields initialized to the corresponding
arguments.
Arguments that correspond to the fields of the
record-type's parent (if any) come first.

If _fieldspecs_ is supplied, then `rtd-constructor`
returns a procedure that expects one argument for each
element of _fieldspecs_ and returns an instance of the
record-type described by _rtd_ with the named fields
initialized to the corresponding arguments.

It is an error if some symbol occurs more than once in
_fieldspecs_.  Fields of a derived record-type shadow
fields of the same name in its parent; the _fieldspecs_
argument cannot be used to initialize a shadowed field.


proc:rtd-predicate[args="rtd"]

Equivalent to the `record-predicate` procedure of the R6RS.


proc:rtd-accessor[args="rtd field"]

_field_ is a symbol that names a field of the
record-type described by the record-type descriptor _rtd_.
Returns a unary procedure that accepts instances of _rtd_
(or any record-type that inherits from _rtd_) and
returns the current value of the named field.

Fields in derived record-types shadow fields of the same
name in a parent record-type.


proc:rtd-mutator[args="rtd field"]

_field_ is a symbol that names a field of the
record-type described by the record-type descriptor _rtd_.
Returns a binary procedure that accepts instances of _rtd_
(or any record-type that inherits from _rtd_) and a new
value to be stored into the named field, performs that
side effect, and returns an unspecified value.

Fields in derived record-types shadow fields of the same
name in a parent record-type.


[[Err5rsRecordsInspectionSection]]

==== Inspection layer

This section describes the `(err5rs records inspection)` library.

proc:record?[args="obj"]

Equivalent to its R6RS namesake.

proc:record-rtd[args="record"]

Equivalent to its R6RS namesake.

proc:rtd-name[args="rtd"]

Equivalent to the `record-type-name` procedure of the R6RS.

proc:rtd-parent[args="rtd"]

Equivalent to the `record-type-parent` procedure of the R6RS.

proc:rtd-field-names[args="rtd"]

Equivalent to the `record-type-field-names` procedure of the R6RS.
(That is, it returns a vector of the symbols that name the fields
of the record-type represented by _rtd_, excluding the fields of
parent record-types.)

proc:rtd-all-field-names[args="rtd"]

Returns a vector of the symbols that name the fields of
the record-type represented by _rtd_, including the fields
of its parent record-types, if any, with the fields of
parent record-types coming before the fields of its children,
with each subsequence in the same order as in the vectors
that would be returned by calling <<rtd-field-names,`rtd-field-names`>>
on _rtd_ and on all its ancestral record-type descriptors.

proc:rtd-field-mutable?[args="rtd field"]

_rtd_ is a record-type descriptor, and _field_ is a
symbol naming a field of the record-type described by _rtd_.
Returns `#t` if the named field is mutable; otherwise returns `#f`.


[[Err5rsRecordsSyntacticSection]]

==== Syntactic layer

This section describes the `(err5rs records syntactic)` library.

The syntactic layer consists of
http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/[SRFI 9]
extended with single inheritance and (optional) implicit naming.

All ERR5RS record-type definitions are generative (unless
Larceny's optional +uid+ feature is used), but
ERR5RS drops the SRFI 9 restriction to top level, mainly
because the R6RS allows generative definitions wherever
a definition may appear.

The syntax of an ERR5RS record-type definition is

----------------------------------------------------------------
    <definition>           
      -> <record type definition>           ; addition to 7.1.6 in R5RS

    <record type definition>
      -> (define-record-type <type spec>
           <constructor spec>
           <predicate spec>
           <field spec> ...)

    <type spec>  -> <type name>
                 -> (<type name> <parent>)

    <constructor spec>
                 -> #f
                 -> #t
                 -> <constructor name>
                 -> (<constructor name> <field name> ...)

    <predicate spec>
                 -> #f
                 -> #t
                 -> <predicate name>

    <field spec> -> <field name>
                 -> (<field name>)
                 -> (<field name> <accessor name>)
                 -> (<field name> <accessor name> <mutator name>)

    <parent>           -> <expression>

    <type name>        -> <identifier>
    <constructor name> -> <identifier>
    <predicate name>   -> <identifier>
    <accessor name>    -> <identifier>
    <mutator name>     -> <identifier>
    <field name>       -> <identifier>
----------------------------------------------------------------

The semantics of a record type definition is the same
as in SRFI 9: the record type definition macro-expands
into a cluster of definitions that

 * defines the `<type name>` as the record-type descriptor
for the new record-type;

 * defines a constructor for instances of the new
record-type (unless the constructor spec is `#f`);

 * defines a predicate that recognizes instances of the
new record-type and its subtypes (unless the predicate spec is `#f`);

 * defines an accessor for each field name;

 * defines a mutator for each mutable field name. 

An ERR5RS record type definition extends SRFI 9 with the
following additional options:

 * If a `<parent>` expression is specified, then it must
evaluate to an rtd that serves as the parent record-type
for the record-type being defined.

 * If `#f` is specified for the constructor or predicate,
then no constructor or predicate procedure is defined.
(This is useful when the record-type being defined will
be used as an abstract base class.)

 * If `#t` is specified for the constructor or predicate,
then the name of the constructor is the type name prefixed
by `make-`, and the name of the predicate is the type name
followed by a question mark (`?`).

 * If the constructor name is specified as `#t` or as an
identifier, then the constructor's arguments correspond
to the fields of the parent (if any) followed by the new
fields added by this record-type definition.

 * If a field spec consists of a single identifier, then

   - the field is immutable;

   - the name of its accessor is the type name followed by
a hyphen (`-`) followed by the field name. 

 * If a field spec consists of a list of one identifier, then

   - the field is mutable;

   - the name of its accessor is the type name followed
by a hyphen (`-`) followed by the field name;

   - the name of its mutator is the type name followed by
a hyphen (`-`) followed by the field name followed by `-set!`. 


[[RecordIdentitySection]]

==== Record identity

Two ERR5RS records with fields are `eqv?` if and only if
they were created by the same (dynamic) call to some
record constructor.
Two ERR5RS records are `eq?` if and only if they are `eqv?`.

Apart from the usual constraint that equivalence according
to `eqv?` implies equivalence according to `equal?`, the
behavior of `equal?` on ERR5RS records is unspecified.
(This is compatible with the R6RS.)

A `define-record-type` form macro-expands into code that
calls <<make-rtd,`make-rtd`>> each time the expanded record-type
definition is executed.
Two ERR5RS record-type descriptors are `eqv?` if and only if
they were created by the same (dynamic) call to
<<make-rtd,`make-rtd`>>.
