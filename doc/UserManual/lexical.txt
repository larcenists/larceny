[[LexicalChapter]]

Lexical syntax
--------------

Larceny's default lexical syntax extends the lexical syntax
required by the R5RS, R6RS, and R7RS <<Standards, standards>>.

The R6RS forbids most lexical extensions, however, so Larceny
provides several mechanisms for turning its lexical extensions
on and off.


[[FlagsSection]]

Flags
~~~~~

By default, Larceny recognizes several Larceny-specific flags
of the form permitted by the R6RS.  The flag you are most
likely to encounter represents one of Larceny's unspecified
values:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    #!unspecified
----------------------------------------------------------------

Certain other flags have special meanings to Larceny's
+read+ and +get-datum+ procedures.  They are described below.


[[CaseFoldingSection]]

Case-sensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Larceny is case-sensitive.
This global default can be overridden by specifying
+--foldcase+ or +--nofoldcase+ on Larceny's command line,
or by changing the value of Larceny's +case-sensitive?+ parameter.

The case-sensitivity of a particular textual input port
is affected by reading one of the following flags from
the port using the +read+ or +get-datum+ procedures:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    #!fold-case
    #!no-fold-case
----------------------------------------------------------------

The +#!fold-case+ flag enables case-folding on data read from
the port by the +read+ and +get-datum+ procedures, while
the +#!no-fold-case+ flag disables case-folding.  The behavior
established by one of these flags extends to the next such flag
read from the port by +read+ or +get-datum+.

Both +#!fold-case+ and +#!no-fold-case+ are treated as comments
by Larceny's `read` and `get-datum` procedures.  (This is a change
from Larceny v0.97.)


[[LexicalExtensionsSection]]

Lexical extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a port is first opened, the Larceny-specific lexical
extensions that are accepted on the port are determined
by Larceny's <<LexicalParametersSection,lexical parameters>>.

The following flags change the case-sensitivity and lexical
extensions on the specific port from which they are read:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    #!r7rs         ; implies #!no-fold-case, enables R7RS syntax
    #!r6rs         ; implies #!no-fold-case, negates other flags
    #!r5rs         ; implies #!fold-case, enables R7RS syntax
    #!err5rs       ; enables R7RS/R6RS syntax with extensions
    #!larceny      ; implies #!no-fold-case and #!err5rs
----------------------------------------------------------------

All of those flags are treated as comments by Larceny's `read`
and `get-datum` procedures.  (This is a change from Larceny
v0.97.)

[NOTE]
================================================================
The `#!r6rs` flag is the only flag that _disables_ lexical
extensions.  To disable R6RS lexical extensions when new ports
are created, use the
<<LexicalParametersSection,`read-r6rs-weirdness?` parameter>>
described below.
================================================================


[[LexicalParametersSection]]

Lexical parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When given no argument, these parameters return the current
default for some aspects of the lexical syntax that will be
accepted on newly created input ports or written to newly
created output ports.
When given an argument, these procedures change the default
as specified by the argument.

The initial values of these parameters are determined by the
`-r7r6`, `-r7`, `-r6`, or `-r5` options on Larceny's
command line.  The `-r6` option disables non-R6RS lexical
syntax; the `-r7`, `-r7`, and `-r5` options allow both
R7RS and R6RS syntax.

proc:case-sensitive?[args="",result="boolean"]
proctempl:case-sensitive?[args="boolean"]

If true, newly created textual input ports behave as though they
began with `#!fold-case`.  If false, newly created textual input
ports behave as though they began with `#!no-fold-case`.

proc:read-r6rs-flags?[args="",result="boolean"]
proctempl:read-r6rs-flags?[args="boolean"]

If true, allows flags other than `#!r6rs` to be read from
newly created ports.
If false, flags other than `#!r6rs` raise exceptions when
read.

proc:read-r7rs-weirdness?[args="",result="boolean"]
proctempl:read-r7rs-weirdness?[args="boolean"]

If true, newly created textual input ports behave as though they
began with `#!r7rs`, and R7RS lexical syntax will be used when
writing external representations to newly created textual output
ports.
If false, R7RS-specific extensions to R5RS/R6RS lexical syntax
may raise exceptions.

proc:read-r6rs-weirdness?[args="",result="boolean"]
proctempl:read-r6rs-weirdness?[args="boolean"]

If true, allows all R6RS lexical syntax on newly created ports
without disabling other lexical syntax on those ports (so
newly created textual input ports _do not_ behave as though
they began with `#!r6rs`).
If false, R6RS-specific extensions to R5RS/R7RS lexical syntax
may raise exceptions.

If `read-r6rs-weirdness?` is true and `read-r7rs-weirdness?`
is false, then the R6RS bytevector syntax will be used when
writing to newly opened textual output ports.  If neither
or both are true, then R7RS bytevector syntax will be used.

proc:read-larceny-weirdness?[args="",result="boolean"]
proctempl:read-larceny-weirdness?[args="boolean"]

Determines whether newly created textual ports allow
Larceny's usual extensions to R5RS lexical syntax.
In addition, this parameter determines whether newly created
ports allow +\#+ as an insignificant digit, which is
required by the R5RS but disallowed by the R6RS and not
required by the R7RS.

proc:read-traditional-weirdness?[args="",result="boolean"]
proctempl:read-traditional-weirdness?[args="boolean"]

Determines whether newly created textual ports allow
certain lexical extensions that are deprecated in Larceny.

[NOTE]
================================================================
The semantics of `read-larceny-weirdness?` and
`read-traditional-weirdness?` will change over time as
deprecated misfeatures are added or dropped in response to
popular demand or apathy.
For the current semantics of these parameters, please consult
the Larceny developers' web page that describes
https://github.com/larcenists/larceny/wiki/LexicalConversion[Larceny's
lexical syntax].
