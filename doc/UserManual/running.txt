Running Larceny
---------------

Larceny can run in any of these distinct modes:

    R5RS              traditional read/eval/print loop (the default)
    R6RS              batch execution of R6RS top-level programs
    R7RS              R7RS read/eval/print loop or batch execution
    Scheme script     batch execution of R7RS/R6RS Scheme scripts

<<R5rsSection,R5RS mode>>
extends the Scheme language described by the R5RS and
IEEE/ANSI Std 1178 by adding R7RS/R6RS lexical syntax and most
of the procedures described by the newer R6RS and R7RS standards.

<<R6rsSection,R6RS mode>>
is largely redundant with Larceny's R7RS mode (because
every reasonable R6RS library and program could just as well be
executed in R7RS mode).  There is only one difference between
those two modes: R6RS mode enforces the R6RS mandates that, among
other things, forbid read/eval/print loops and most extensions
to R6RS lexical syntax.

<<R7rsSection,R7RS mode>>
will accept any combination of R7RS and R6RS libraries
and programs.  In Larceny, R6RS Scheme becomes a proper subset of
R7RS Scheme.

<<SchemeScriptsSection,Scheme scripts>>
are directly executable R7RS/R6RS programs.

[[R5rsSection]]

R5RS mode
~~~~~~~~~

When you start Larceny in R5RS mode (the default), you
will be presented with a banner message and the
read-eval-print loop's prompt:

------------------------------------------------------------
    % larceny
    Larceny vX.Y "<version_name>" (MMM DD YYYY HH:MM:SS, ...)
    larceny.heap, built ...
        
    > 
------------------------------------------------------------

You can enter a Scheme expression at the prompt.
After a complete expression has been read, it will
be evaluated and its results printed.

[NOTE]
================================================================
In native Larceny, the expression is evaluated by
compiling it to native machine code, which is then executed.
In Petit Larceny, the expression is evaluated by
an interpreter because compiling to C, running the
C compiler, and loading the compiled C code would
take too long.  Interpreted code behaves like compiled code,
so most of what this manual says about the compiler is also
true of Petit Larceny's interpreter.
================================================================

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
By default, Larceny's Twobit compiler makes several
assumptions that allow it to generate faster code;
for example, the compiler assumes Scheme's standard
procedures will not be redefined.
To obtain strict conformance to R5RS semantics, see
the section of this user manual devoted to
<<PerformanceSection, performance>>.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


[[R6rsSection]]

R6RS mode
~~~~~~~~~

To execute a top-level R6RS program that is contained
within a file named `pgm`, type:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    larceny -r6rs -program pgm
----------------------------------------------------------------

The `-program` option can be omitted, in which case
Larceny will read the top-level program from standard
input:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    larceny -r6rs < pgm
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you omit the `-program` option and do not redirect
standard input, then Larceny will wait patiently
for you to type a complete top-level program into
standard input, terminating it with an end-of-file.

You probably don't want to do that.  Had you wanted to
type R6RS code at Larceny, you'd be using Larceny's R7RS
read/eval/print loop instead.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
By default, Larceny's Twobit compiler uses settings
that make good sense for production code but violate
some absolute requirements of the R6RS.  For maximal
adherence to R6RS requirements (at the expense of
portability, interoperability, and/or performance),
see the discussion of
<<compiler-switches, `compiler-switches`>>
in the section on the
<<LarcenyCompilerSection, `(larceny compiler)`>>
library.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


[[Err5rsSection]]
[[R7rsSection]]

R7RS mode
~~~~~~~~~

To execute a top-level R7RS/R6RS program that is contained
within a file named `pgm`, type:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    larceny -r7rs -program pgm
----------------------------------------------------------------

To interact with Larceny's R7RS read/eval/print loop,
omit the `-program` option:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    % larceny -r7rs
    Larceny v0.98 "General Ripper" (...)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The `(scheme base)` library has already been imported,
but you may want to import other libraries as well.
For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    > (import (scheme read)
              (scheme write)
              (scheme file)
              (scheme cxr)
              (scheme inexact)
              (scheme complex)
              (scheme char)
              (scheme load))
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you'd rather have Larceny import all of the standard R7RS and
R6RS libraries at startup, along with a few Larceny-specific
procedures, you can use the `-r7r6` option instead of `r7rs`:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    % larceny -r7r6
    Larceny v0.98 "General Ripper" (...)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Using the `-r7r6` option is equivalent to using the `-r7rs`
option and then importing the `(larceny r7r6)` library.

[NOTE]
================================================================
One name conflict could not be resolved by adding R7RS extensions
to the conflicting R6RS procedure or syntax.  When the `-r7r6`
option is used, the `bytevector-copy!` procedure is imported with
R7RS semantics, and the older R6RS version of that procedure is
renamed to `r6rs:bytevector-copy!`.
================================================================

The `features` procedure will return a list of all `cond-expand`
features and libraries available to you.  That procedure reads
the source code for all library files found in your current
<<R7rsLibraryPathSection,Larceny library path>>, so don't be
surprised if it takes a few seconds.

----------------------------------------------------------------

[[R7rsAutomaticLoadingSection]]

==== Automatic loading

As an extension to the R7RS and R6RS, Larceny attempts to load
libraries automatically when they are first imported.
Autoloading makes interactive development and
<<CompilingChapter,separate compilation>>
much more convenient.

All of Larceny's
<<R7rsPreDefinedSection,predefined libraries>>
can be autoloaded.

To enable autoloading of other R7RS/R6RS libraries,
including libraries you've written yourself, you can:

- use the <<R7rsLibraryPathSection,`-path` command-line option>>
- use the <<R7rsLibraryVariableSection,`LARCENY_LIBPATH`>> environment variable
- use <<current-require-path,`current-require-path`>>
- edit `startup.sch` in Larceny's root directory
- add the libraries to Larceny's `lib` directory


[[Err5rsDynamicLoadingSection]]
[[R7rsDynamicLoadingSection]]

==== Explicit loading

Larceny automatically loads R7RS/R6RS libraries when
they are first imported.  This is usually the most
convenient way to load a library, but autoloading
can't be used to load a top-level program.  Explicit
loading is needed for top-level programs, for libraries
that don't reside in Larceny's
<<current-require-path,`current-require-path`>>,
and for libraries that are defined in files whose names
do not follow Larceny's
<<NamingChapter,standard naming conventions>>.

In theory, explicit loading is the only portable way for R7RS
programs to load a library.
<<LibraryResolutionSection,
There is no portable way for R6RS programs to load or import libraries>>,
so R6RS programs must rely upon implementation-specific
mechanisms such as Larceny's autoloading.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Explicit loading also makes it possible to write portable
programs whose source files conform to both the R5RS and
ERR5RS.  Two different configuration files, one for the
R5RS and one for ERR5RS, can perform all of the imports
and loads needed to run the program.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For explicit loading of nonstandard libraries, top-level
programs, or unadorned R5RS-style code from a file, you
must first import a suitable load procedure:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    > (import (scheme load))
----------------------------------------------------------------

Loading a library does not automatically import it.
To use the variables and syntax that are exported by a
library, you must import that library explicitly:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    > (load "lib/R6RS/larceny/benchmarking.sls")
    > (import (larceny benchmarking))
    > (time (vector-for-each + (make-vector 1000000 0)))
    Words allocated: 3053286
    Elapsed time...: 25 ms (User: 25 ms; System: 0 ms)
    Elapsed GC time: 3 ms (CPU: 2 in 2 collections (1 minor).)
----------------------------------------------------------------

In Larceny, you may omit the call to `load` because the
`(larceny benchmarking)` library will be autoloaded when
it is imported.  In other implementations of the R7RS, you
may have to load all of the nonstandard libraries that will
be imported by a top-level program or library before you
load that top-level program or library.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You do not have to import those libraries into the R7RS
top level, however, unless you want to use the variables
and syntax exported by those libraries in the expressions
and definitions you evaluate at the top level.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


[[Err5rsPreDefinedSection]]
[[R7rsPreDefinedSection]]

==== Predefined libraries

Larceny predefines several nonstandard libraries in addition
to the standard R7RS and R6RS libraries, and autoloads them
for your convenience.  The predefined, autoloadable libraries
include:

Composite library:

    (larceny r7r6)                         ; all R7RS/R6RS standard libraries

R7RS standard libraries:

    (scheme base)
    (scheme case-lambda)
    (scheme char)
    (scheme complex)
    (scheme cxr)
    (scheme eval)
    (scheme file)
    (scheme inexact)
    (scheme lazy)
    (scheme load)
    (scheme process-context)
    (scheme r5rs)
    (scheme read)
    (scheme repl)
    (scheme time)
    (scheme write)

R6RS standard libraries:

    (rnrs base (6))                        ; R6RS chapter 9
    (rnrs unicode (6))                     ; R6RS library chapter 1

    (rnrs r5rs (6))                        ; R6RS library chapter 19

R6RS standard libraries that are autoloadable but deprecated in Larceny
because they have been superseded by the R7RS and SRFI 99 record
facilities:

    (rnrs records procedural (6))          ; R6RS library section 6.3
    (rnrs records inspection (6))          ; R6RS library section 6.4
    (rnrs records syntactic (6))           ; R6RS library section 6.2

SRFI libraries:

    (srfi 1 lists)                         ; list library
    (srfi 2 and-let*)                      ; extended `and` and `let*`

    (srfi 67 compare-procedures)           ; three-way comparison procedures
    (srfi 78 lightweight-testing)          ; lightweight testing
    (srfi 87 case)                         ; a more general case clause
    (srfi 98 os-environment-variables)     ; environment variables

    (srfi 116 ilists)                      ; immutable lists

[NOTE]
================================================================
For backward compatibility,
`(srfi 1 lists)` through `(srfi 101 random-access-lists)` are also
available with the SRFI 97 naming convention in which the number is
preceded by a colon, as in `(srfi :1 lists)`.
With the more liberal R7RS syntax, that SRFI 97 naming convention
is now unnecessary.
Larceny has extended the R6RS `library` syntax to allow R6RS libraries
to import R7RS libraries that follow the R7RS naming convention shown
in the list above.
================================================================

SRFI libraries that are autoloadable but deprecated in Larceny,
usually because they have been superseded in whole or in part by
R7RS or R6RS libraries or syntax (shown in parentheses):

    (srfi 0)                               ; cond-expand (scheme base)
    (srfi 30)                              ; nested multi-line comments (#| |#)
    (srfi 34)                              ; exception handling (scheme base)
    (srfi 55)                              ; require-extension (import)
    (srfi 60 integer-bits)                 ; see (rnrs arithmetic bitwise)
    (srfi 62)                              ; S-expression comments ( #; )
    (srfi 66 octet-vectors)                ; octet vectors (scheme base)
    (srfi 69 basic-hash-tables)            ; hash tables (rnrs hashtables)
    (srfi 71 let)                          ; extensions of let, let*, letrec
    (srfi 74 blobs)                        ; see (rnrs bytevectors)
    (srfi 95 sorting-and-merging)          ; sorting and merging (rnrs sorting)

ERR5RS libraries that are autoloadable but deprecated in Larceny
because they have been superseded by the R7RS and SRFI 99 record
facilities:

    (err5rs records procedural)            ; ERR5RS records (procedural API)
    (err5rs records inspection)            ; ERR5RS records (inspection API)
    (err5rs records syntactic)             ; ERR5RS records (syntactic API)
    (err5rs load)                          ; ERR5RS load procedure

Other autoloadable libraries:

    (larceny load)                         ; extension of (err5rs load)
    (larceny compiler)                     ; separate compilation (R7RS/R6RS)
    (larceny benchmarking)                 ; timing facilities
    (larceny profiling)                    ; profiling of Scheme code
    (larceny r7r6)                         ; all R7RS/R6RS standard libraries
    (larceny records printer)              ; custom printing of records
    (larceny shivers-syntax)               ; syntax favored by Olin Shivers
    (r5rs)                                 ; approximates the R5RS top level
    (explicit-renaming)                    ; macros with explicit renaming

==== Library path

Larceny's autoload feature locates R7RS/R6RS libraries
by performing a
<<LibraryTranslationSection, depth-first search>>
of the directories that belong to Larceny's
<<current-require-path,`current-require-path`>>.
Libraries will not be autoloaded unless they are defined
in files whose names follow
<<NamingChapter, Larceny's standard conventions>>.

The
<<current-require-path,`current-require-path`>>
is initialized by the `startup.sch` file in Larceny's root
directory.

<<R6rsLibraryPathSection, Larceny's `-path` command-line option>>
adds one or more directories to the directories in the
<<current-require-path,`current-require-path`>>.
On most systems, you can specify multiple directories
by separating them with a colon; under Windows, use a
semicolon as separator instead.  The first directory
listed will be searched first.

The <<R6rsLibraryVariableSection, `LARCENY_LIBPATH`>>
environment variable can also be used to add one or more directories
to the directories in the
<<current-require-path,`current-require-path`>>.
Multiple directories should be specified as with the `-path` option.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
[[R6rsPreDefinedSection]]

==== Predefined libraries

The R6RS standard does not specify any way for a
top-level program to define its own libraries.
Portable R6RS programs are therefore limited to
importing a subset of the R6RS standard libraries.

As an extension to the R6RS, Larceny allows R6RS
top-level programs and Scheme scripts to import
any libraries that are
<<Err5rsPreDefinedSection,predefined in Larceny's ERR5RS mode>>.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


[TIP]
================================================================
If you have a set of portable libraries that run under more than
one implementation of the R7RS, and you want to have a special
version of some of those libraries for Larceny, you can put all
your portable versions in one directory and the Larceny-specific
versions in another.  When you run Larceny, use the `-path`
option and specify the Larceny-specific directory first.
================================================================

[NOTE]
================================================================
The `-path` option cannot be used by Scheme scripts,
because command-line options are passed along to the Scheme
script without being interpreted by the `scheme-script` processor.
================================================================

[WARNING]
================================================================
We emphasize that these extensions are non-portable.
Other implementations of the R7RS or R6RS may not provide
anything comparable to Larceny's `-path` option or
`LARCENY_LIBPATH` environment variable.
Even if they do, their mappings from library names
to file names may be incompatible with Larceny's.
================================================================


[[DefiningLibrariesSection]]

==== Defining libraries

As an extension to the R7RS and R6RS, Larceny allows a top-level
program or Scheme script to define R7RS/R6RS libraries within
the file that contains the top-level program or Scheme
script, before the import form that begins the top-level
program.  These libraries must be arranged so that no
library depends upon libraries that come later in the
file.

[WARNING]
================================================================
We emphasize that this extension is non-portable.
================================================================


[[ERR5RSprimitivesSection]]
[[R7rsPrimitivesSection]]

==== Importing procedures from Larceny's underlying R5RS system

Any of Larceny's R5RS-mode top-level procedures can be imported
into an R7RS or R6RS library or program by using an import
declaration with a `primitives` clause that names the R5RS
procedures to be imported.  For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    (import (primitives random current-seconds
                        getenv setenv system
                        current-directory file-modification-time)
            (scheme time))
----------------------------------------------------------------

[WARNING]
================================================================
This feature is highly non-portable.
Other implementations of the R7RS or R6RS may not even
have an underlying implementation of the R5RS.
================================================================


[[SchemeScriptsSection]]

Scheme scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On most Unix systems (including Linux and Apple's OS X), Larceny's
`scheme-script` will execute Scheme scripts as described in R6RS
non-normative appendix D, with or without the optional script
header.  To make Scheme scripts executable in their own
right, without executing `scheme-script` directly, add Larceny's
root directory to your path as described in `doc/HOWTO-INSTALL`,
or edit `scheme-script` to define `LARCENY_ROOT` and copy that
edited `scheme-script` to a directory in your path.

Suppose, for example, that `/home/myself/hello` is an R7RS/R6RS
Scheme script whose first line is the optional script header
shown below:

----------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env scheme-script
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not have execute permission for this script,
or Larceny's root directory is not in your path,
you can still run the script from
Larceny's root directory as follows:
     
----------------------------------------------------------------
    % ./scheme-script /home/myself/hello
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you have execute permission for the script, and Larceny's
root directory is in your path, you can also run the
script as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    % /home/myself/hello
----------------------------------------------------------------

If, in addition, the directory that contains the script is
in your path, you can run the script as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    % hello
----------------------------------------------------------------

You may also pass command-line arguments to a Scheme script.

[WARNING]
================================================================
We emphasize that Scheme scripts are not portable.
Scheme scripts are specified only by a non-binding appendix
to the R6RS, not by the R6RS proper.
Other implementations of the R7RS or R6RS may not support Scheme
scripts at all, or may give them a semantics incompatible
with Larceny's.
================================================================

On Unix systems, standard input and output can be redirected
in the usual way.  In Larceny, standard input corresponds to
the textual port initially returned by `current-input-port`,
and standard output corresponds to the textual port initially
returned by `current-output-port`.

[WARNING]
================================================================
We emphasize that redirection of standard input and output
is non-portable.
Other implementations of the R7RS or R6RS may not allow redirection,
or may identify the standard input and output with ports
other than those initially returned by `current-input-port`
and `current-output-port`.
================================================================


[[R5rsScriptSection]]

R5RS scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose `hello.sch` contains the following R5RS code:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    (display "Hello world!")
    (newline)
    (exit)
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can run `hello.sch` as a script by executing Larceny as
follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    % larceny -nobanner -- hello.sch
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can redirect Larceny's standard input, in which case
you may want to eliminate the herald announcement and the
read/eval/print loop's prompt:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    % larceny -nobanner -- -e "(begin (herald #f) (repl-prompt values))" \
              < hello.sch
----------------------------------------------------------------

For an explanation of why that works, which may suggest other
creative uses of Larceny, ask for help:

----------------------------------------------------------------
    % larceny -help
----------------------------------------------------------------


[[ErrorsSection]]

Errors
~~~~~~

In R6RS mode, which is batch-only, errors should result in an
error message followed by a clean exit from the program.

If your program encounters an error in an interactive mode
(R5RS or R75RS), it will enter the debugger; this is
believed to be a feature.

Despite its crudity, and to some extent because of it,
Larceny's debugger works at least as well with optimized
compiled code as with interpreted code.

If you type a question mark at the debugger prompt, the
debugger will print a help message.  That message is more
helpful if you understand the Twobit compiler and
Larceny's internal representations and invariants, but
this manual is not the place to explain those things.

The debugging context is saved so you can exit the debugger
and re-enter it from the main read/eval/print loop's prompt:
    
----------------------------------------------------------------    
    > (debug)
----------------------------------------------------------------    

The debugger is pretty much a prototype; you don't need to
tell us how bad it is.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

==== Errors when starting Larceny

Although Larceny runs on x86-64 machines, it requires 32-bit
libraries that are not always installed on Linux and MacOS X
machines.  If those libraries are absent, the operating system
will probably give you a mysterious or misleading error message
when you try to run Larceny.  For example, the operating system's
loader may tell you "larceny.bin not found" even though it's
perfectly obvious that `larceny.bin` is present within Larceny's
root directory.  To install the necessary 32-bit libraries on
Linux machines with x86-compatible processors, someone with
superuser privileges must incant

----------------------------------------------------------------
    sudo apt-get install lib32z1
    sudo apt-get install libc6-i386
----------------------------------------------------------------

[WARNING]
================================================================
The names of those 32-bit packages have changed over time, and
may change again.
================================================================

For Macintosh machines, someone with administrative privileges
must install the
https://developer.apple.com/opensource/[Apple Developer Command Line Tools].

When attempting to run an R7RS/R6RS program, you may see
a warning about "`loading source in favor of stale
fasl file`",
following by a long series of error messages about
syntactic keywords used as a variable, ending with
the kind of error you'd expect to see when a large
R7RS/R6RS program is fed to a Scheme compiler that was
expecting to see R5RS-compatible code.  That means
the R7RS/R6RS runtime and standard libraries were not
installed correctly, or their source files have been
touched or modified since they were last compiled.
To fix the problem,
<<CompilingStdLibSection, recompile the R7RS standard
libraries>>.

The precompiled binary forms of Larceny should run on
most machines that use an appropriate processor and operating
system, but the executable program "`larceny.bin`" may be
incompatible with very old or with very new versions of
the processor or operating system.  If that appears to be
the case, you should see whether a newer version of Larceny
fixes the problem.  If not, please report the problem
to us at `larceny@ccs.neu.edu`.
Please report success stories as well.


==== Errors when compiling the R7RS runtime

If something goes wrong while
<<CompilingStdLibSection,compiling the R7RS runtime>>,
make sure you are running the copy of Larceny you think
you are running and have read and write permission
for +lib/R7RS+, +lib/R6RS+, +lib/SRFI+,
and all their subdirectories and files.
If you get an error message about something being
"`expanded against a different build of this library`",
then one or more of the compiled files in
+lib/R7RS+ or +lib/R6RS+ or +lib/SRFI+
or its subdirectories has gone
<<CompilingChapter,stale>>.
Removing all `.slfasl` files from +lib/R6RS+ and +lib/SRFI+ and
their subdirectories will eliminate the stale file(s).

[WARNING]
================================================================
Don't remove the `.sch`, `.scm`, `.sls`, or `.sld` files.
================================================================


[[AutoLoadErrorsSection]]

==== Autoloading errors

If Larceny attempts to autoload an imported R7RS/R6RS
library but cannot find the library, then the library
may be defined in a file that doesn't follow
<<NamingChapter,Larceny's standard naming conventions>>.
Another possibility is that the `-path` option was
omitted or incorrect.

If an R7RS/R6RS library is recompiled, then all compiled
libraries and top-level programs that depend upon it must
also be recompiled.  In particular, recompiling the standard
R7RS runtime will invalidate all compiled libraries and
top-level programs.  Larceny's `compile-stale` script
and the
<<compile-stale-libraries,`compile-stale-libraries`>>
procedure of `(larceny compiler)` make it convenient
to recompile all of the libraries and top-level
programs within any given directory in an order
consistent with their dependencies.



[[CrashesSection]]

==== Crashes

Please report all crashes with as much information is possible;
a backtrace from a debugger or a core dump is ideal (but please
do not mail the core dump without contacting us first).
Larceny's run-time system is compiled with full debugging
information by default and a debugger like GDB should be able
to provide at least some clues.


[[PerformanceSection]]

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Larceny's Twobit compiler performs several optimizations
that are fully compatible with the R7RS but may not be fully compatible
with the older R6RS, R5RS, and IEEE-1178 standards.

When compiling R5RS code, Larceny's Twobit compiler normally
makes several assumptions that allow it to generate faster code;
for example, the compiler assumes Scheme's standard
procedures will not be redefined.

To obtain strict conformance to R5RS semantics at
the expense of slower code, use R5RS mode and
evaluate the expression

----------------------------------------------------------------
    (compiler-switches 'standard)
----------------------------------------------------------------

To make the compiler generate faster code, you can promise not to
redefine standard procedures _and_ not to redefine any top-level
procedure while it is running. To make this promise, evaluate

----------------------------------------------------------------
        (compiler-switches 'fast-safe)
----------------------------------------------------------------

To view the current settings of Twobit's numerous compiler switches,
evaluate

----------------------------------------------------------------    
        (compiler-switches)
----------------------------------------------------------------

All of Twobit's compiler switches are procedures whose setting
can be changed by passing the new value of the switch as an
argument.

// benchmark-block-mode broken for a long time; commenting out below

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
To make
<<compile-file,`compile-file`>>
generate faster code, you can promise that none
of the top-level variables that are defined within a file of Scheme
code are redefined or assigned outside of that file unless they are
redefined or assigned within the file. To make this promise, evaluate
    
    
        (benchmark-block-mode #t)
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For more information, evaluate

----------------------------------------------------------------
        (help)
----------------------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
================================================================
That `help` procedure is predefined only in R5RS mode, and
some of the help information that will be printed may be
irrelevant to the heap image you are using.
================================================================

To alter the compiler switches from R7RS mode, or
to disable certain compiler optimizations that are
incompatible with the R6RS, see the section that
describes the
<<LarcenyCompilerSection, `(larceny compiler)` library>>.
