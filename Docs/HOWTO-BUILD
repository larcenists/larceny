Building and using Larceny and Petit Larceny

HOW TO BUILD LARCENY AND USE THE BUILD ENVIRONMENT

These instructions tell you how to build minimal versions of Larceny or
Petit Larceny for your system.  If you run into trouble or think you
need more information, look at the files HOWTO-PETIT and HOWTO-SPARC.

For the most part Larceny and Petit Larceny are built by tools written
in Scheme, so you need a working host Scheme system; any recent version
of Larceny with just the interpreter is sufficient.  See the section
BOOTSTRAPPING in HOWTO-PETIT if you don't have a working Scheme system.

First things first:

  * You must inspect features.sch and choose the configuration you are
    building.

  * You will probably need to edit Rts/Makefile to make it fit your
    system -- "make" is used to build the run-time system.

Then start your host Scheme system, change your working directory to be
the Larceny source directory if it isn't already, and load the
appropriate configuration file for your operating system:

Native Larceny:

    Util/sparc-unix.sch		   (SPARC/Solaris and probably SPARC/Linux)

Petit Larceny:

    Util/petit-unix-be.sch         (Big-endian Unix, including MacOS X)
    Util/petit-unix-el.sch         (Little-endian Unix, including Cygwin)
    Util/petit-win32.sch           (Microsoft Windows)

These programs sometimes invoke external programs and may place
additional demands on your host system.  Currently all host systems need
some version of "make" to be able to build the run-time system, and will
need access to a command interpreter.

The first time you run the build environment you must evaluate:

    > (setup-directory-structure)

Whenever you have altered ~/features.sch or any of the Rts/*.cfg, or
the first time you run the build environment, you will want to
evaluate:

    > (build-config-files)

Most of the time you will just load Twobit (you can't load Twobit
until after you have created the directory structure and config files,
which is why it is a separate step):

    > (load-compiler)

and then build the heap image, the runtime system, and finally the
executable:

    > (build-heap)
    > (build-runtime)
    > (build-petit)             ; only for Petit Larceny

Other useful commands are:

    > (remove-heap-objects)     ; removes generated files (LAP/LOP/C/OBJ/FASL)
    > (remove-runtime-objects)  ; removes OBJ files in the Rts/ tree


BUILDING AN APPLICATION

It is possible to create an application that contains more compiled code
than the standard heap image.  The method whereby this is done differs
between native Larceny and Petit Larceny; see HOWTO-SPARC and
HOWTO-PETIT for more information.


COMPILING TWOBIT

The method for building Twobit also depends on whether you are running
SPARC-native Larceny or Petit Larceny.  See HOWTO-SPARC and HOWTO-PETIT
for more information.


COMPILING AND LOADING YOUR OWN PROGRAMS

On some systems it is possible to load compiled Scheme code dynamically.
The method for compiling loadable code also depends on whether you are
running SPARC-native Larceny or Petit Larceny.  See HOWTO-SPARC and
HOWTO-PETIT for more information.


INSTALLING LARCENY ON YOUR SYSTEM

Installing Larceny without Twobit is simple:

  (1) Create a suitable directory for Larceny's files, say,
      /usr/lib/larceny

  (2) Copy the Larceny executable and the heap image (petit.heap or
      sparc.heap) to that directory.

  (3) Create an executable script called 'larceny' in another suitable 
      directory to run Larceny, usually it contains something like this:
        /usr/lib/larceny/petit /usr/lib/larceny/petit.heap
      or 
        /usr/lib/larceny/larceny.bin /usr/lib/larceny/sparc.heap

Now type 'larceny' anywhere and you're up and running.


INSTALLING TWOBIT ON YOUR SYSTEM

Installing Twobit outside the Larceny build directory is more
complicated, see HOWTO-SPARC and HOWTO-PETIT.
