Information about Petit Larceny on Win32
29 November 2004 / lth


HOW TO BUILD

See HOWTO-BUILD and HOWTO-PETIT for information about how to build
Petit Larceny in general.  The configuration script you use depends on
the compiler:

    Util/petit-win32.sch        MinGW, CodeWarrior, Visual C/C++, etc
    Util/petit-unix-el.sch      gcc under Cygwin

BUILD-APPLICATION and BUILD-TWOBIT work, and it is possible to load
the code-less .FASL files created by these commands and to dump the
resulting heap images.

However, The COMPILE-FILES command and dynamic loading of compiled
code (.FASL files that reference shared object files) does not yet
work on this platform.  See section below for technical information on
this problem.

There is a working call-out Foreign-Function Interface (FFI) to C.
It works even from the interpreter; no C compiler is required.


COMPILER: MINGW (gcc on Windows)

MinGW ("Minimal GNU for Windows") is a port of gcc to Windows.  It
brings many useful GNU tools to Windows while allowing you to continue
working in a Windows environment (unlike Cygwin, say).  It is
available from http://www.mingw.org.

I have used a version of MinGW with gcc 3.2.3, and the Windows command
shell.  Larceny does not yet run properly under the MinGW shell (MSYS).

As long as you make sure to add the MinGW program directory to your
path before starting the command shell, everything works smoothly.


COMPILER: CODEWARRIOR

I have used Metrowerks CodeWarrior 6.0 for Windows.  Generally it
works OK, and it generates decent code.

The libraries are buggy, and there are some workarounds for CodeWarrior
in the Larceny run-time system.

There is a bug in CodeWarrior that causes it to hang when compiling
certain large C files (notably Lib/Common/ehandler.c) at high
optimization levels.  As a consequence, the default switches for
CodeWarrior are "-opt on" rather than "-opt full".  CodeWarrior for
the Macintosh has the same problem.

CodeWarrior is not fast.  It can take a long time indeed to compile
some of the generated files.

The CodeWarrior command-line tools work fine, as long as you've
configured your environment variables properly.  This is not easy.
Here are my settings:

	CWFolder=c:\program files\metrowerks\codewarrior
	MWCIncludes=%CWFolder%\MSL\MSL_C\MSL_Common\Include;
		    %CWFolder%\MSL\MSL_C\MSL_Win32\Include;
		    %CWFolder%\Win32-x86 Support\Headers\Win32 SDK;
		    %CWFolder%\MSL\MSL_C\MSL_X86;
		    %CWFolder%\Win32-x86 Support\Headers\Win32 SDK\sys
	MWLibraries=%CWFolder%\MSL\MSL_C\MSL_Win32\Lib\x86;
		    %CWFolder%\MSL\MSL_C\MSL_X86;
		    %CWFolder%\Win32-x86 Support\Libraries\Runtime;
		    %CWFolder%\Win32-x86 Support\Libraries\Win32 SDK
	MWLibraryFiles=ANSICX86.LIB;ansifp_x86.obj;mwcrtl.lib;user32.lib;kernel32.lib


COMPILER: MICROSOFT VISUAL C/C++

I have used Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0 Personal Edition.  This
compiler is inexpensive and generates poor code.  The resulting
performance is poor.  This compiler is not a good choice for Larceny.
(The Professional Edition generates much better code, but I have not
used that to compile Larceny.)

One problem with this compiler is that it does not merge the locations
of local variables with nonoverlapping lifetimes, so Scheme code that
is compiled to large C functions tends to have large stack frames.
For example, the reader procedure has a stack frame that is 3.5KB
large.  As a result, the longjmp jump discipline will require a large
stack or very frequent stack prunings.  I have not been able to
specify a large enough stack for this to work reliably!  (I tried
stacks as large as 1MB.)  This should not matter to most users, as
this jump discipline is not the default.

The command line tools are fine, but getting the symbols files right
for debugging takes some work.  Here are some old notes about this:

  It is painful to link with /Zi to get (rudimentary) debug information
  for compiled scheme code.  The problem seems to be that the debug
  info database is always called vc60.pdb and is co-located with the
  library, *and* the library must be compiled with a lib-path that
  indicates the location of the pdb (it seems).  For the time being, I
  compile the compiled scheme code with /Zd and then delete the
  resulting pdb before linking; this gives full debug info for the RTS
  but very little for the compiled scheme code (enough for the moment).

  To run under debugger, start MSVC and select 'File | Open workspace'
  and then open petit.exe as the workspace; then run.  Breakpoints can
  be set; variables in the RTS can be inspected (full debug info).

For some compilers the BUILD-PETIT command can result in warnings
during linking; it is safe to ignore them.


COMPILER: GCC UNDER CYGWIN

Cygwin emulates Unix well enough that Petit Larceny can be compiled
out-of-the box, as on a Unix system.

The main problem with using Cygwin is that Larceny does not become a
Windows program, and will not run under the DOS command shell, instead
requiring a Cygwin shell.  But the Cygwin shell does not provide
reasonable command line editing for Larceny, making it painful to use.


FOREIGN FUNCTION INTERFACE

If you wish to access operating system functionality: There is a
callout-only FFI implementation in Ffi/ffi-i386.sch, it has been
integrated into the FFI system via Ffi/ffi-load.sch.

Note that libc is not loaded by default, so you will have to arrange
for that if you use the Ffi.


PROBLEMS WITH COMPILE-FILES AND DYNAMIC LOADING

It is not currently possible to load code compiled with COMPILE-FILES
and the Windows-native compilers (MinGW, CodeWarrior, Visual C/C++, etc).

The technical reason is a combination of two inconvenient facts: these
compilers do not align functions on four-byte boundaries, and shared
objects are loaded at addresses that the loading program cannot
control reliably.

Larceny's data representations were designed to accomodate a native
compiler for the SPARC platform.  Only one word was reserved in the
representations for procedures and stack frames for a code pointer.
The garbage collector requires this word to have a representation it
can understand.  On the SPARC the code pointer is a bytevector or a
literal code address (which looks like a fixnum); in Petit Larceny it
is either an integer (represented as a fixnum) or a pointer to a
function.  If all functions are aligned on at least four-byte
boundaries then the function pointers look like fixnums, and there is
no problem with the garbage collector.  Otherwise, the representation
must be transformed.

None of the Windows-native compilers align function pointers, for some
reason, and do not provide switches to force the alignment, so a
transformation must be implemented.

The easiest way to transform the function pointer is to shift it two
bits left when storing it and to shift it two bits right when using
it, but this only works if the top two bits are zero.  One can refine
this for any constant top two bits; for example, if all DLLs are
loaded at address 0xC0000000 or higher, then the top two bits are 11,
and so on.  On Windows, this works for the executable itself -- but
not for dynamically loaded objects.  The loader will place the
dynamically loaded code where it wishes and it cannot be predicted
where that will be.

One can try to work around that by storing the top two bits in the
typetag field of the procedure header, but that only works for
procedures, not for stack frames, where there are no available bits.
(Even for procedures this would be a disgusting hack.)

One can imagine several fixes.

 - Change the representations to accomodate larger code pointers.
   This has ramifications for code that manipulates the
   representations (including the SPARC assembler and any Scheme code
   that knows about procedure layouts, like the debugger) and is a
   fair amount of work, but it is arguably The Right Thing.

 - One can implement a custom loader that controls the placement of
   the code.  This is probably straightforward for the kind of code
   that is generated by Larceny; only a few fixes are needed (eg, all
   millicode calls must be made via the globals vector, not to named
   procedures that are linked into the dynamically loaded code).

 - One can make the C compiler generate assembler code, then go over
   that assembler code and insert alignment directives, and finally
   compile the assembler code to object code.
