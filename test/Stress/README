Setup
-----
The bench shell script must be run from this directory.  When it is
run, there must be a link IN THE DIRECTORY TWO LEVELS UP to an
executable 'larceny' and links IN THAT DIRECTORY to two heap images:
'r5rs.heap' should be the basic heap image, and 'twobit.heap' should
be the twobit heap image.

Note, even though 'bench' can benchmark other scheme systems there
are hard-coded paths in the script that may have to be edited before
such benchmarking will work.

Running
-------
To run, say:
	./bench larceny all

If the purpose of the run is to test performance, then
 - r5rs.heap should be a link to a heap that should have been
   initialized, re-dumped and treated with -reorganize-and-dump;
   linking to larceny.heap works fine
 - all files should reside on a local file system


Summarizing
-----------
To summarize results, load summarize.sch into a Scheme system and then
run

	((summarize larceny-results) "results.Larceny")

Note that successive runs of bench append the output to results.Larceny.
