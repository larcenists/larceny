Testing the garbage collector.

The test programs in this directory exercise Larceny's garbage
collector.  Each benchmark should be compiled (use MAKE-GC-TESTSUITE),
loaded into a fresh Scheme system, and then run several times in
succession.  The configurations, parameters, and number of runs used is
currently as follows:

Executable/settings

larceny
  (no switches)         Default configuration
  -nonursery            Old default configuration
  -np                   Default with non-predictive collector
  -heaps 1              Stop-and-copy system
  -np -heaps 3 -size2 1M -size3 2M    Reasonable generational system

A fast machine is better -- some of these programs take a while.  Also,
plenty of real memory is a plus, since the heap size can grow over 30MB
for some programs.
