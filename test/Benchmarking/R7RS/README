This directory contains a set of R7RS benchmarks.  Most were
derived from a very similar but larger set of R6RS benchmarks.

Some of these benchmarks were originally collected by Richard
Gabriel, while others were collected or written by Marc Feeley
and Will Clinger.  Abdulaziz Ghuloum converted about 50 of the
benchmarks to R6RS libraries.  R6RS libraries are non-portable
by design, however, so Clinger rewrote the benchmarks as R6RS
top-level programs and added a script for running benchmarks
on Unix systems.  Clinger also added new benchmarks for R6RS.

Files and directories:

  * bench   : a shell script for running benchmarks
  * src     : contains R6RS code for the benchmarks
  * inputs  : contains inputs for the benchmarks
  * outputs : will hold the outputs of some benchmarks

For succinct instructions on running benchmarks, run the
bench script without any arguments:

  % ./bench

The bench script creates a /tmp/larcenous directory to hold
the source code constructed for the benchmarks.

The bench script appends its results to files with names
like results.Gauche, results.Larceny, and so forth.
