;;; TAIL -- One of the Kernighan and Van Wyk benchmarks.
;;;
;;; Modified for R7RS by Will Clinger.
;;;
;;; The key idea of this benchmark is that, for each iteration,
;;; the entire input is read line by line before any output
;;; is produced, and the lines are then written to the output
;;; in the reverse of the order in which they were read.
