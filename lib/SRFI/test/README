Tests for the SRFI implementations.
===================================

R5RS
----

To run the tests, just load the test programs into Larceny.  (If you
have not set up Larceny to load SRFI-0 on startup, you must load it
manually before loading the tests.  Try evaluating
    (require 'srfi-0)
for example.)

There are occasionally interactions between the test programs: SRFI-5
redefines LET, some SRFIs require yet others to be precent (eg, SRFI-1
requires SRFI-8), and some SRFIs redefine identifiers defined in
others (eg FORMAT).  Thorough testing probably requires loading each
test into a clean system to avoid interactions.

R6RS
----

To run the tests, just run run-r6-tests.

R7RS
----

To run the tests, just run run-r7-tests.

Most of the R7RS tests are identical to the corresponding R6RS tests
except for these changes:

    R7RS test files end in .sps7 instead of .sps
    R7RS test files import .sld files instead of .sls

FIXME: the R7RS tests mostly duplicate the R6RS tests.
